(lively instrumental music)

- Pretty fancy buggy.

- I like it.
- Pretty fancy driver.

You gonna eat lunch in here?

- I'd planned to.

- Swell, so am I.



- Uh, do I know you?

- You don't have to be introduced formal.

- No, but I prefer it.

- Okay, lady.

Excuse me for trying to be friendly.

- They put a guy in jail
and he pops right out again.

It's a waste of the taxpayers' money.

What'll it be, folks?

As if the taxes aren't
high enough already.

- Coffee and a hamburger.

- I'll have an egg salad sandwich

and a glass of pineapple juice, please.

- Well, I might have
to look for the juice.

Won't you have, um--



- I'll wait.

- Is that what you run that jalopy on?

Pineapple juice?

- Uh-huh.

- Well, I'll go look for it.

Be right back.

- Ever race it?

- Hmm.

- You ought to look into that race

that goes to Mexico, The International.

- I'm racing it.

- Real sport, huh?

- [Waitress] I couldn't
find anything back there.

But I put your hamburger on.

- Oh, forget it.

Grapefruit juice will do.

- That I know we haven't got.

Say, did you two hear about that guy

that broke out of jail up in Coachella?

Some jail they got up there, huh?

I'm telling you, honey,

it ain't safe on the road these days.

- I wouldn't worry.

- Well, worry or not, it ain't safe.

This guy, they call Webster,

drove a truck right off the road.

Murder, that's what it is.

- You can say that again.

- Murder.

You from up that way?

- A buddy of mine told me about it.

- Cops got him and let him go again.

- He won't get away from us.

- You and who else?

- Listen, every trucker on the highway

is watching for this guy.

We'll find him.

When we do, he won't even have time

to think about getting away.

- What do you mean?

- I could shoot as straight as any cop.

- [Waitress] Well, they
put it on the radio

what he looks like.

But they said they didn't
have a picture of him.

- Cops.

Just keep your eye open.

- Oh, don't worry, I do.

I talk to people all the time

and I get to figuring 'em out, too.

- You wanna take my money?

- Yeah.

This guy don't seem much
interested in the case.

- I wonder if you could
get the pineapple juice?

Now?

- Sure, lady, be right back.

- Hitchhiking?

- Nope.

- I didn't see your car out there.

- I'm walking.

- Oh, I'll give you a lift.

What's your name?

Bob Nielson's mine.

- Myers, Bill Myers.

- Myers, huh?

Where you from?

- You ask a lot of questions, Mr. Nielson,

but I'm from El Centro.

- Hmm.

Right near where Webster
killed that guy, huh?

You know him, Webster?

- Nope.

- Hear about it?

- How can I help?

- Interested?

- No.

No, I'm not.

- If I'm giving you a lift, Myers,

I'd like to see your identification.

- I didn't say I wanted a lift.

- Maybe I better see it anyway.

- Sure.
- Oh, no you don't.

- Stop it, both of you!

(grunting)

He's hurt.

We better get a doctor.

- Come on.

- Where do you think you're going?

- Mexico.

- You're not gonna leave that man here.

- With you.

Give me the car keys.

- Webster?

- Come on.

(tense instrumental music)

- Well, I had to turn
everything upside down,

but I finally found...

Well, where is everybody?

(dramatic instrumental music)

Oh!

Oh.

Operator.

Operator, get me the police.

Right away, quick.

Hello, hello, police?

This is Wilma Belding at
the Saddle Peak Lodge Cafe.

Yeah, yeah, Wilma, W-I-L--

What?

I wanna re, a repor, I
wanna report a murder.

Yes, a murder!

I can't tell you about it on the phone.

Highway 74.

Oh, for heaven's sake, hurry up.

- It's a police car.

(siren blaring)

- I've got a bullet for
them and one for you.

You're gonna see a lot of
cops and lots of people

before we cross the border.

Just behave yourself.

Act natural and there
won't be any trouble.

I like quiet women.

Stay that way.

- There's a gas station ahead.

Better fill up before dark.

- You can do better than that.

- All right, look at the gas gauge.

(bell dings)

- What'll it be, folks?

- Fill her up.

- Right.

Keys?

- Huh?

- You want the gas in
the gas tank, don't you?

- Could you tell me where
the ladies' room is, please?

- It's over there, lady.

- Thank you.

Excuse me.

- Your wife?

- Nope.

- Pretty girl.

- Yeah.

Hey, will you check the
oil and the tires, please?

- Yep.

I got me a pretty hot little old V8.

It's a wreck but I had it modified,

and she goes like a bomb.

Headed through the tracks up at Dry Run.

Did 103 miles an hour.

What will this one do it in?

I said, what will this one--

(hood slams)

Been talking to myself.

- Going someplace?

- Well, she's all checked
out and ready to go.

That'll be $4.

Sure a nice day to go cruising around.

Weather's like this tomorrow,

I'm gonna take my old
wreck and go for a spin.

- You interested in racing?
- Well, I just fool around.

Got my old wreck to the point

where she'll go from zero
to 50 in just 12 seconds.

What will this one do it in?

(engine roaring)

(tires screeching)

She does.

But he don't seem like the Jag type.

(siren blaring)

(tires screeching)

- We got the call only
a few miles from here.

- What took you so long?

- He's still alive.

You better call an ambulance.

Did you see it?

- I was right here when he shot him.

- There's no gun wound.

- Well, it must have been Frank Webster.

- How do you know?

- Well, I was the one that recognized him.

I told this fella here that's who he was,

and then that girl that--

- A girl with Webster?

- Well, she must have been.

She sent me out to the back room

and when I came back, he was lying there.

- Then you didn't see it.

- Well, I practically did.

- This is Samuels.

I'm at the Saddle Peak Lodge Cafe.

Yeah, that's right.

Gonna need an ambulance out here.

Not determined yet.

That's right.

Right.

- What was the girl like?

- Oh, kinda, you know, the kind of girl

you'd see with a guy like that.

- Did you know what kind
of car they were driving?

- A jalopy.

- Did you see it?

Can you describe it?

- No, I didn't.

But that's what he called
it, the one they shot.

He called her car a jalopy.

- You better broadcast
what you can figure out.

- Young man, a woman, old car.

- Yeah.

Get roadblocks set up.

I wonder if you could
come down to headquarters.

- Sure.

- Good.

- I'd love to get out of this death trap.

Funny thing, here I am talking to a guy

who turns out to be Frank Webster.

And then this dame comes in
and orders pineapple juice.

And I was telling her,

a lady just ain't safe on
the streets these days.

Do you want a cup of coffee?

- Huh-uh.

- Then I find him on the floor.

I better put some lipstick on.

They might want to take my picture, huh?

And then I noticed this other guy

wasn't a bit interested in the case,

so I told the girl, I says, look.

- I'd appreciate you returning
my car and my freedom.

- You said that before.

- I'm running out of variations.

I'm also running out of patience.

- Any idea what to do about it?

- Several ideas.

None of which I intend
to discuss with you.

- I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble.

- Oh, don't let it bother you.

I guess I should be grateful
you haven't murdered me yet.

- Don't tempt me.

- What do you expect
to get out of all this?

- You and this fancy car are my passport

out of this country.

I expect to get a few more years to live.

- And I'd suppose you'd
do anything to get there.

- Just about.

Don't try that again.

I don't want to see you hurt.

- Why not?

- [Frank] 'Cause you're a nice kid.

Besides, I haven't got time.

- I hate you.

- Just hate me all the way to Mexico.

- I not only hate you, I dislike you.

- I always did have
trouble making friends.

- You're conceited, ruthless, cruel.

(suspenseful instrumental music)

- Got a road map?

Turn on the dash lights.

- Now what do you think you're doing?

- If that trucker talked,

they'll be looking for me in this car.

- You hope he's dead.

- What?

- So he can't describe the car.

- Sure, Connie, sure.

There's a road here.

If I...

We're going over the mountains
and around the cops, okay?

- Am I supposed to say yes?

- Yes.

(siren blaring)

- Stop this car.

He's liable to shoot,
is that what you want?

(suspenseful instrumental music)

Stop the car!

- Just don't make a move.

- In a rush, aren't you, folks?

Just wanted to tell you
your taillight's out.

Better get it fixed.

You know, for a while there,

I thought you were running away from me.

With all this speed, you ought to save it

for the racetrack, don't you think?

Well, take it easy along here.

- Got any more ideas?

- Not at the moment.

- Let's take a walk.

Come on!

You're more trouble than you're worth.

- Why didn't that officer
recognize you back there?

- Maybe he's not one of my fans.

Start looking.

- For what?

- [Frank] The ignition
key, what did you think?

The diamonds?

See anything?

- I'm not looking.

- Got any matches?

Listen, if you want to play rough--

- I don't want to play at all.

- Well, then don't!

- All I want is you to give me back my car

and let me alone.

- I would have to pick
on someone like you.

- Someone will come along soon.

- With my luck, you're probably right.

Connie Adair, huh?

- What are you doing?

- I'm gonna try to make this thing start.

- Without a key?

- It wasn't my idea, you know.

Would you care to tie yourself
to the wheel or shall I?

- It's almost midnight.

- Do you ride off on a broom?

(coyote howling)

(engine rumbling)

Don't you know coyotes
were afraid of humans?

- Start all your cars this way?

- Only the ones I steal.

What's that?

- An extra key.

- Why didn't you tell me you had it?

- Why didn't you ask me?

- I don't think you can get
much out of him, Sergeant,

but you can try.

- Critical?

- It's difficult to say.

Must have hit his head pretty hard.

- Mr. Nielson, can you hear me?

I'm a policeman.

Can you give me any information?

Can you hear me?

- Why don't you try telling
him what you think happened?

He may respond to that.

- You were in a fight, Nielson.

A man and a woman were there.

Do you know who they were?

Do you know what kind of
car they were driving?

Can you tell us?

Were they driving an old car?

Do you know the man who hit you?

Couldn't it have been Frank Webster?

He's trying to speak.

- He slipped off again.

Nurse?

Call me if anything develops.

These concussions are pretty
tricky things, Sergeant.

- This isn't necessary.

- Of course not.

- I said I was sorry.

- You're about the sorriest
creature I've ever known.

(tense instrumental music)

- Please leave me alone.

- I intend to.

- You're-- you're not
gonna sleep like this.

- Would you rather change sides?

- Please untie me.

- I like to have you close.

Don't worry.

I've known things to go
along like this for years.

And then get worse.

- I don't know who you
think you're lookin' for.

- Well, it could have been Webster.

- But I thought you said it
was some fancy kind of car.

- He could have changed cars.

(groans)

- This country reminds me of the time

I was bitten by a rattlesnake.

Only 5 years old.

Me, not the snake.

The snake died.

- It figures.

- What's the matter?

Did you get up on the
wrong side of the car?

- I don't like this belt around my wrists.

- It suits you.

All the comforts of home.

Go wash your face.

- [Broadcaster] And you'll wake
up feeling fresher, happier,

and ready to beat the world.

Now here's late news on the manhunt

for the truck driver wanted for murder.

Police have broadcast the
description of Frank Webster,

still reported at large.

In a wild race through
the Coachella Valley,

Webster forced another truck into a ditch.

The truck overturned
and killed the driver.

Webster was arrested,
but escaped from jail.

Now a general alarm is out
for this dangerous criminal,

and police through the
southern half of the state

are combing the area all
the way to the border.

It is reported Webster is
accompanied by a young woman,

but nothing is known of her.

- They make you sound so exciting.

Not at all like you.

(tires screeching)

- Hey, you stop more than you ride.

- Well, whoever they were,

they must have gone on
through to the highway.

- Uh, maybe.

Doesn't hurt just to keep trying, though.

I wish I'd taken a better
look at them last night.

- Oh, let's take a break.

Once over this road is enough for me.

(tense instrumental music)

- We'll coast around the cops.

Come on.

- I'm hungry.

I'm still hungry.

- So am I.

- The welcoming committee.

- They sure get up early.

- You know, for some reason,
I'm going to miss you.

- Thanks.

Maybe you won't get a chance.

Who's in those sport cars?

- I don't--
- Racers, maybe?

Headed for the race?

- I suppose.

- Mexico, huh?

- They'll recognize you.

- Not if you're a good girl.

And if you are, when this is all over,

you'll still be alive.

And beautiful.

- You'll never get away with it.

- Maybe not.

But I'm gonna try.

Viva Mexico.

Remember what I told you.

Don't try anything.

- You with the others?

- Yeah.

- Where you going?

- Mexico.

- This your, uh, wife, Mr...?

- Myers, Bill Myers.

What's the trouble, officer?

- Looking.

- So Mr. Myers and his
wife are going to Mexico.

Where do they start from?

How do they get there, hmm, Mr. Myers?

Uh, are you going to ride with me

in The International tomorrow?

- You're so right.

- Oh.

- Tell the sergeant he's coming around.

And tell him to hurry.

Mr. Nielson?

Mr. Nielson?

- How is he?

- Better make it fast.

- I'm a policeman.

I'm trying to help you.

Try to understand--

a man and a woman were in the cafe.

A man attacked you.

Do you know what they were driving?

Can you remember?

- Jag, Jag.

- Yes, go on.

- He's unconscious again.

- Jag.

What do you suppose he means by that?

- Think the waitress could
shed any light on it?

- No, no, she couldn't.

Jag.

Jag.

Jaguar.

Jaguar, it's a racing car.

The waitress said it was a jalopy.

Anyway, at this point,
we've got to try anything.

But tomorrow, most of those cars

will be at The International
fenced into a five-acre park.

- Well, now that we're in the park,

we could stop and have lunch.

Or is that impossible?

- It is.

- Maybe you'd rather
register for the race.

Or is that impossible, too?

- Register?

Look, Connie, will you give me a break?

- Why should I?

You drive people off roads,
leave injured men unconscious.

- Maybe someday I can explain.

All right, don't give me a break.

Just remember, I've got a
gun and I know how to use it.

- Checkpoint number one.

Checkpoint number one.

Number 54, JL Clancy, approaching fast.

Get that truck off the course.

Let Clancy pass.

Okay, Clancy.

Oh, hiya, folks.

Going to register?

- Yes.
- Yeah.

- All right, just the write
the name of the driver

and the car there.

Okay, Clancy.

You've qualified.

Number 54, Clancy, you've qualified.

Come on in.

Oh, Miss Constance Adair driving?

- Yes.
- Yes, I--

- I guess you hadn't heard.

They had a meeting last night.

This course is too dangerous.

All the lady drivers are banned.

- But I've got to.

- [Announcer] I'm sorry, but
that's what they decided.

- Ugh.

I'll drive.

- Oh, you're a racer, too?

- Put me down.

- What name?

- Myers.

Bill Myers.

- Address?
- El Centro.

- Identification?

Okay, that does it.

This is a map of the course, Mr. Myers.

Now first, the qualifying run today

is the first two miles of tomorrow's race.

That keeps the trials
entirely within the park,

and we allow one run to get
familiar with the course.

Nice going, Clancy!

Now, after you've made this practice run,

double back over this road

and make a running start
for your qualifying run.

That'll be checked by an electric timer.

But just remember, this
race is over the old road,

through the mountains,
along the coast into Mexico.

It's a dangerous course.

People can get killed.

- Yeah.

Well, Miss Adair can
ride with me, can't she?

- Well, for the trials if she wants.

But not tomorrow.

You know, we've always had
nothing but drivers in this race.

Are you ready now?

- As ready as we'll ever be.

- Well, uh, here are your numbers, 55.

Stick them on before the test.

Well, I'll be watching you and--

(laughs)

Well, what's the matter, young lady?

Are you hungry?

Well, yes, I am.

Well, if you'd like a sandwich--

- No thanks, never mind.

She's always hungry.

(chuckles)

- Notice all checkpoints.

Notice all checkpoints.

Number 55, Bill Myers, is about to start.

Clear all portions of the course.

Clear all portions of the course.

- Hi, honey.

Connie!

- Faber, I--
- Connie, what's the matter?

- They had a meeting last night.

Won't allow any women drivers.

- Oh, poor little Connie.

Some of them are the fastest
drivers in the business.

- And the best.

- That's what I meant.

You gonna take over?
- Guess so.

Well, we better get
started with the trials.

- I never saw this car before.

Is it fully modified?

- What?
- You seem pretty new at this.

Done much racing?

- A little.

- It'll take more than that.

You're in with the best drivers
in the country in this one.

- That's what I hear.

- Toughest road I've ever been on,

and I've been over them all.

- Good for you.

- Say, Connie, why don't you just pull out

as long as you can't drive.

I said, Connie, why
don't you just pull out

as long as you can't drive.

Might be easier than taking
a chance with the car.

- I think I can manage it.

- Apparently.

Say, Connie, how about
taking in the antique race

with me this afternoon?

Or are you busy with your driver?

- We'd be glad to.

Thanks.

- What are you, her keeper?

- Sure thing.

Thanks.

(tires screeching)

You forgot your numbers!

- [Announcer] All right, checkpoint two.

Straighten that line
of bales near the edge.

Pull the truck off the
course till Myers goes by.

- Where'd you get the Bill Myers?

- From a drunk of that name.

It was a small jail.

You might say we traded.

Nice boyfriend you got there.

- Thank you.

- One of your crowd, I suppose.

If he didn't have money, he
wouldn't last five minutes.

- He might even become
a criminal, like you.

- If he got lucky.

- Here.

Put this on.

You may as well look the part.

They'll put hay bales on the track

to protect you during the race.

- Dangerous course, huh?

- Yes.

Especially for hay trucks.

(tires screeching)

Gear down!

Put it into lower gear at all sharp turns.

Don't lose RPMs.

- You mean like this?
- Yes.

Now step on the gas
after we hit the curves.

Ever driven a sports car before?

- [Frank] No, but I've driven everything

from hot rods to tanks.

- [Connie] With the gear down in first,

you don't have to nurse the motor back

once you shift into high.

Seconds count.

The way you drive, you
didn't run that truck

off the road by accident.

- I thought you already decided that.

Would you like to win the race?

- I always like to win.

- I don't think I can make it.

- I don't think you will.

- Thanks.

- What?

- I said thanks!

- You're welcome!

- Okay, Myers, you can double back

to your qualifying run now.

- This is going to be a crowded one.

- Yeah.

- Mr. Hillman?

- Yes, what can I do for you?

- Officer Faraday of the state police.

Wonder if I could check
over your list of entrants.

- Why, yeah, sure, but why?

- We're looking for someone

who might be hiding out in the park.

We think he's driving a Jaguar.

- Well, that's a new one.

- It sure is.

- Well, I'll do anything
I can to cooperate.

- You've checked all the identifications

of the entrants?

- Oh, yes, they'll cross
the border, you know.

- We don't expect to see him in the race,

but we have to take every precaution.

- Well, go right ahead, officer.

Okay, Myers, this is your qualifying.

Let her go.

(suspenseful instrumental music)

- Post 12, that truck!

Post 12, that truck!

(tires screeching)

All right, you guys in the
trucks, that was close,

but now maybe you know what
I've been talking about.

Nice driving, Myers.

- You and trucks just
don't seem to get along.

- You can say that again.

How are we doing?

- Don't lose speed.

- I won't.

- Agh!

Oh, wow!

(laughs)

- Looks like the little lady

sure approves of her driver there.

Okay, 55.

Myers, 55.

You've qualified.

Second fastest time so far.

That will put you second to
last at the starting line.

- Second to last.

- I sure get the breaks.

- I feel almost as
sorry for you as you do.

- You're a real fighter, aren't you?

- And you're a criminal wanted for murder.

- Yeah.

And now you can add kidnapping.

We're getting out of
this little playground.

- Did you find anything to help you out?

- No, thanks.

I'll just hang around
and keep my eyes open.

- This can't be a roadblock.

- Oh, but it is.

- You'd think I was Dillinger.

- Does all this attention
make you feel important?

- Not very.

You didn't get word to them.

- I wish I had.

- I'll bet you do.

You're lovely, all the way.

Hi!

What's going on down there?

- Oh, the cops, they're looking for a guy

that they think is here in the park.

- This should be a crazy place to hide.

- Well, you never know what
they're gonna pull next.

They figure he's gonna
be driving a Jaguar.

- What makes them think that?

- Some fellow broke out
of jail with a murder rap.

They don't expect him to be racing,

but with that kind of a car,

he'd hang around here
until the heat's off.

- I doubt it.

- Uh, you folks racing?

- Wouldn't miss it.

- Hey, that's a nice-looking
Jag you got there.

They're, uh, looking for him

to have a young woman with him.

- Come on, Bill.

If you're going to get
any rest, we better go.

- Say, the fella they're
looking for is Frank Webster,

in case you run into him.

Good luck in the race.

- Thanks.

- Oh, let's take a break.

- Why here?

- Nobody ever comes here.

There's an old house up the road.

It's been abandoned for years.

(gentle instrumental music)

- Thanks again.

- I discovered this place
when I first started

coming down to the races.

I've sort of considered
it mine ever since.

Won't you come into my parlor?

- What's the pitch?

- Nothing.

I'm just tired.

So are you.

Besides, you said something
about an explanation,

and I'd like to hear it.

- On the level?

- Well, at the moment, the only
thing I have against you is

I never got that egg salad sandwich.

- Suppose the starter's accusing his wife

of not packing a lunch.

- Frank!

- You run away?

- Later.

(giggles)

(gentle instrumental music)

- Maybe we can mail it to him.

- Nice hideout, huh?

- Couldn't be better.

- You know, I've never
seen anyone else here.

- Good spot.

- No cops, no robbers, no people.

When are you going to
give yourself up, Frank?

- I'm not going to.

- You've got to face that jury sometime.

- If you've got some romantic idea

that I'm gonna give myself up

and face a jury that's stacked against me,

you can forget it.

- What makes you so sure

the jury's going to be against you?

- Connie, look, you're a smart girl.

You know a lot about Jaguars,

but don't tell me about a fix
in a small town when it's mad

or a card game when you
haven't got any cards.

- Look, Frank, the whole
world isn't against you.

You'll get an even break
if you give it a chance.

- Sure, give it a chance.

Listen, Connie, all my life I've been

trying to get by on my own

because that's the way I figured it.

After the army, I saved some money,

so I bought myself a truck.

Not two trucks or a fleet.

No partners, just me.

Turned out, I was bothering somebody.

Guy who owned a lot of trucks.

He tried everything.

Undercut me, everything.

But I figured I had my rights, so I stuck.

Then one of his drivers
tried to run me off the road.

All I was trying to do was
keep from getting killed.

And his truck went over the side.

- Then how can they accuse you of murder?

- Two minutes later, one of
his other drivers was there,

yelling his head off

about how I drove his
buddy over the cliff.

He didn't even seem to
care much that he was dead.

- Why did you break out of jail?

No jury in the world would convict you

if you told them what happened.

- If I got to a jury.

Those truckers were coming to get me.

They weren't waiting for a trial.

I had to break out of jail.

- That gang of hoodlums

probably slept it off the next morning.

If you go back now,

they won't have anything to do with it.

- They've got everything to do with it.

- You can't prove you're
innocent running away.

- I can't prove it dead.

- Look, I'll tell them
what happened at the cafe.

We'll get lawyers.

You've got to believe in yourself.

In the law.

In someone.

- Sure.

Sure, Connie.

Frank.

- How do?

- Good afternoon.

- Is that your car?

- Yeah.

- Well, you ain't supposed
to be here, you know.

- No.

No, I didn't know.

- Are you folks from the races?

Sure would like to see them.

Boy, that's a good-looking car.

Luckily, I came by.

You know, after sunset,
the cops patrol the park.

And they arrest you and pinch you.

- Cops would come here?

- Yeah, looking for the kids, you know.

Kind of, uh, a Lovers' Lane.

(chuckles)

Well, good evening.

- Frank, I didn't know.

- You're smart, like I said,
Connie, but not smart enough.

- Frank, I swear.

- Got any more hideouts, cute spots,

picnic spots nobody knows about?

Trust somebody.

You see why I don't?

- Well, what do you expect?

You hate the world and
the world hates you.

And that specifically and
especially includes me.

Oh!

Let go of my arm.

- I'll break it for you if
you try any more tricks!

- Faber!

Hey, Faber!
- Sit down!

- [Faber] Connie!

- Just waving to my boyfriend, you know.

We have a date.

- You wouldn't go without me, would you?

I'm serious, Connie.

Don't try anything.

- Hi there.
- Hi.

- Where have you two been hiding out?

Say, this isn't a big romance, is it?

- Of course not.

- What time does the antique race start?

- We ought to make it just about now.

Connie, I'll let you ride with me.

- No, thanks.

We'll meet you there.

- Okay, don't run away again.

- And in this opening race,

we have everything but
the Stanley Steamer.

Oh, oh, I take it all back.

Wait a minute.

Here is the Stanley Steamer,

ready to defend its honor
against the Model T.

(laughs) Wait a minute.

(laughs)

Here comes Dennis Maxwell.

(laughs)

Well, folks, you can see for yourselves,

the race is about to begin.

- Not everybody can get
in the marshal stand.

- Looks like everybody has.

- Tell me, where have you
two been all afternoon?

- Oh, we just picked up a bite of lunch.

- When are you gonna get your pit check?

- Huh?

- I said when are you going
to get your pit check?

- You made your point.

Why didn't you tell him?

- Isn't it exciting?

Oh, we're going to get checked over

and gassed up in the morning.

- Say, Mr. Myers, how'd you and Connie

ever meet each other?

- Oh, look.

- And now we have the announcement

of the winner in this, the last race.

Mr. AJ Jones driving his Maxwell.

- How about something to eat?

- Fine.

- Would you like to join us, Mr. Myers?

- Yeah, thanks.

- [Announcer] The winning cars
of the Concours d'Elegance

are now on display on the lawn.

The grand prize winner in
the $10,000-and-over class,

a Rolls-Royce convertible

owned by Mr. Jack Milner of Beverly Hills,

is at the head of the line.

- A man who drives as well
as you should see this.

- Sure, it'll be an education.

- He'll be so interested.

- May we see your car, sir?

- You certainly may.
- Thank you.

Now, this is one of the few

convertible Rolls-Royces ever made.

Exactly like the one owned
by the king of Denmark.

- It's beautiful.

- Say, Connie, the way you
stowed away those hot dogs,

I thought you said you'd just had lunch.

- It's the fresh air.

The peace and quiet of the country.

- Peace and quiet.

They're keeping it undercover,

but a friend of mine told me
they're looking for a murderer.

A guy named Frank Webster.

They think he's in the park.

- I should think this would
be a nice place to hide out.

- They don't actually
know he's guilty, do they?

- He's guilty.

Say, where'd you say you were from?

Bill, isn't it?

- El Centro.

- Oh?

Say, do you know Elmo Redding up there?

- No, I don't.

- That's funny.

Thought everybody knew Elmo.

Owns half the town.

- No, I don't remember him.

- Say, how'd you and
Connie ever get together?

- I needed a driver.

I heard they might ban women drivers,

so I asked Bill to drive for me.

- Thought you said you
haven't driven much.

- But he has.

He's driven lots.

- You don't look like a sports-car man.

- How can you tell?

- Well, it's a rather expensive hobby.

- Money doesn't make a good driver, Faber.

- Well, I didn't say it did, Connie.

All I said was that Bill didn't
look like a sports-car man.

He looks more like a truck driver to me.

- Come on, Bill, let's
get over to the pit.

- Say, Connie, I never thought
I'd see you with that type.

- You'll never see me
with your type either.

- [Announcer] Mrs. John Howell,

your small son Peter is
at the announcer's booth.

He says he isn't lost, but you are.

If anyone has a set of extra
spark plugs for a Ferarri,

please check--
- This is

where we get checked over.

Eddie!

- Hi, Miss Adair, how are you?

- Fine, Eddie.

How are you?

- Can't complain.

How's the car feeling?

- Oh, it's fine, too.

Would you check it over for me?

- I guess you're not driving in the race.

- This is Bill Myers.

He's driving.

- She sure is a hot one, Mr. Myers.

- She sure is.

Can I leave it here tonight

and get it first thing in the morning?

- I'll have it ready for you
first thing in the morning.

- Thanks, Eddie.

Hey, Sally.

- Hi, Connie, how are you?

Where's your wheels?

- Oh, we left our car in the pit.

- Hi, you been buzzing
any hay trucks lately?

- No.
- That was the most.

- Oh, Sally Phillips, this is Bill Myers.

- Glad to know you.

Come on, we're going to a party.

- Whose?

- Mine.

- What for?

- For fun.

- I mean, what's the occasion?

- Oh, all of us lady drivers
who aren't allowed to drive

are going to celebrate breaking training.

- Now, you know you've
never been in training.

- Doesn't mean I can't break it.

Come on.

Say, where are you two staying tonight?

Or, um, should I ask?

- We're looking.

- [Sally] You'll never
find anything around here.

This town's packed.

You wanna stay with us?

- Oh, we don't want to
intrude on your folks.

- It won't be any trouble.

We'll have a ball.

You haven't got a friend, have you?

- No.

- Believe me, he hasn't.

- Well, it won't be any intrusion.

My folks are gonna be up all night anyway.

- How come?

- My dad's a deputy and
they're looking for a man.

- Oh, goodness sakes.

- But then who isn't?

But they'll be out beating the bushes

and coming back for coffee and out looking

and coming back for sandwiches

and, well, let's go.

- No, I just remembered,
we do have a place to stay.

- Oh, well, you can come
for a drink, can't you?

- No, I'm afraid not.

It'll make us late.

- If you're in such a
rush, I'll give you a lift.

- No, it'll make us late.

Thanks.

- I'm beginning to understand
why you haven't got a friend.

Think it's worth it, Connie,
to find a guy that can drive?

- Well, nice to have met you, Miss.

- Likewise, I'm sure.

Say, if you don't want to go to the party,

would you like to join the manhunt?

- No, thanks.

- I didn't think so.

- Where are we going, Frank?

- Park's getting hot.

- Wouldn't you rather
give up and get caught?

- No.

Come on.

Me and that car together are
just too hot for this park

till we're on our way to Mexico.

- Well, where are we going now?

- For a walk.

If it takes all night.

- Oh, Frank, what on Earth
are you trying to prove?

- That it's harder to hit a moving target.

- But you keep moving.

- I'd feel safer with you.

- You don't even trust me, do you?

- Any reason why I should?

- Oh, no, of course not.

I haven't been any help at all.

- You're good company, though.

- Couldn't we just stop
by the side of the road?

- No!

- What's wrong with that?

- I said no!

(panting)

- I'm tired.

- Exercise is good for your figure.

- There's nothing wrong with my figure.

- I've noticed.

- I'm not going any farther.

(tense instrumental music)

- Everybody's on your side.

(sighs)

- Oh!

Oh.

I like it here.

- I thought you would.

Come on.

- Oh, no.

Oh.

Oh, Frank, you're as tired as I am.

- Don't tell me you like it here, too.

I just want to carry
you over the threshold.

It may not be much, but we call it home.

- How did you know about it?

- Criminal mind.

Always checking hideouts.

- Oh, Frank, why didn't you tell me

we were coming someplace definite?

- I like surprises.

- Well, I don't.

(bird cawing)

Oh, Frank.

- It'll look better after
the furniture arrives.

- I'd rather walk.

- Don't go away.

- Oh, Frank, you're not
still afraid I'll run away.

- We kid around a little, Connie,

but this is life and death, mine.

So we'll play it real safe.

- All I want you to do is give yourself up

and face the charges.

- And I want you to
mind your own business.

- Okay.

For all I care, you can go to Africa.

And stay there.

Why should I try to--

- Don't cry.

- I'm not.

- Why should I try to convince you that--

- I love you.

(gentle instrumental music)

Morning.

- Good morning.

- Come here.

Great day for the race.

You're beautiful in the morning.

I'll miss you.

- You won't have the opportunity.

- Meet me in Mexico?

- If you go to Mexico,

you'll give up the only chance you've got.

- That's not the way I see it.

- Well, believe me, you see it wrong.

If you give me a chance, I'll prove it.

- Send me a postcard.

- Don't you want me?

- I want you.

You're the most beautiful
thing I've ever known.

But I can't afford to stay.

- Oh, but you're innocent.

- It isn't what you are that counts.

- It is!

- It's what you get taken for.

- Someday what you really are
is going to catch up with you.

Be worth fighting for.

I just hope it isn't too late.

- Thanks for everything.

- Frank!

- I'll tell them where you are.

- Oh, Frank.

Please, don't do this.

- I'm sorry.

- [Announcer] All drivers who have not yet

signed their insurance forms,

please report to the booth.

Dr. Samson, call your office.

- Hi, Eddie.

- Oh, good morning, Mr. Myers.

- How is she?

- Great little car.

She's in top shape.

(engine revving)

- Help!

Help!

Help!

Somebody come let me out!

- [Announcer] Your attention, please.

All cars on the starting line.

All cars.

- Good luck, Mr. Myers.

- [Announcer] Jackson 39,
get in the starting line.

This is the feature
race, The International,

a 98-mile race into Mexico.

The track is closed.

- Where's Connie?
- Watching.

- She sure has a lot of faith in you.

- Seems to.

- Too much, in my opinion.

I still don't think you belong here,

and I think I'll prove it.

Good luck.

- Thanks for everything.

(dramatic instrumental music)

- Help!

Help!

Help, help!

- [Announcer] Torres is back up now.

The race will start any moment.

They're off!

- [Connie] Help!

Help!

Help!

(tense instrumental music)

Can you give me a ride to the races?

- Sure, but--
- I'll explain later.

- [Announcer] The field is spreading out.

Daniels in the lead,

Robinson second, Nagel third.

As the cars go into the straightaway,

Daniels is holding the
lead, but Nagel is moving up

to challenge Robinson for second.

All moving down the course,

individual duels are shaping up.

Trading the field are the
two fastest qualifiers--

Bill Myers in 55 who's driving cautiously,

but he's being pushed by Faber Hatfield,

who's driving that very hot 17c

and wants to make a real race of it.

It's Nagel off and running very fast,

but he's planning out of the turn

and takes the escape path.

He's turning around now and
coming back onto the track.

He'll have trouble getting
their lead back again.

Bill Myers and Faber Hatfield
are still fighting it out,

with Hatfield pressing Myers all the way,

almost forcing him to stay in there.

He's crowding Myers into the turn,

and Myers can't make it.

He's out on the escape route,

but swinging around
and back up the course,

picking up speed.

He was driving cautiously up to this,

but now he's really moving.

Maybe he wants to pay Hatfield back

for that crowding on the turn.

But he'll have to catch him first.

Entering turn number seven,
he's moving into the lead.

Jensen second in 59, spins
out, but he's all right.

It's a very sharp turn,

and the boys are taking it fast.

Hatfield is still moving up on Myers,

who's trying to get
back up there with him.

Gordon leads pack into turn number seven,

where Jensen spun out.

(tires skidding)

Myers is back in the race
and now pressing Hatfield.

Myers passes!

As they approach the
last turn onto the park,

it's Tupper holding the lead

with Daniels pressing close behind.

Myers and Hatfield

are in a challenging
position for the lead,

and they swing out of the park

and into the mountains
on the way to Mexico.

For further progress on this
great race, The International,

listen to the bulletins on your radio.

- All right, there's the phone,

but I don't see what
good it's gonna do you.

The race has already started.

- Operator?

Give me the police.

Police?

Listen very carefully.

The driver of car 55 in The
International is Frank Webster.

Just try to stop him at the border.

He's innocent.

Thanks for the lift.

- Well, it looks like
it's okay now, Eddie.

- Yeah, she's all ready.

- Harrison.
- Connie, how are you?

- Harrison, can I use your--
- Too bad

you can't drive in the race.

Connie, what's the matter?

- Why aren't you racing?

- Something happened to the starter, but--

- Is it all right now?

- Yeah, sure, but--
- Could I use your car?

- Connie, it's too late
to drive in the race.

- I've got to get to the border.

I'll use the main highway.

- Say, what is this?

- I'll explain it later.

It's important to me, Harrison, please.

- Hey, Eddie, is she ready to go now?

- [Eddie] Perfect.

- Connie, are you sure you're all right?

- I will be.

Thank you, Harrison.

(engine revving)

(tense instrumental music)

- The white Jag, here he comes.

(gunshots)

- What is it?
- That's Frank Webster.

- I'll get him.

(suspenseful instrumental music)

- You all right, Faber?

- Yes, thanks.

- He's all right.

(distant sirens blaring)

How'd the cops find out?

- I turned you in.

- How'd you get out?

- Set the building on fire.

- You're a pretty dangerous
character yourself.

- You could have run away
instead of helping him.

Why didn't you?

- Because you're right, Connie.

And I'm going back.

Besides, I'm getting used to you.

- Oh, Frank.

What you really are is worth fighting for.

And it isn't too late.

- For us, it's just the beginning.

(dramatic instrumental music)


I got a feeling
this is going to be a riot

I don't read
the news papers

Because they all have

ugly print

Bring it on, bring it on

Bring it on

At the starting
of the week

At summit talks
you'll hear them speak

It's only Monday

Negotiations breaking down

See those leaders
start to frown



It's sword and gun day

Tomorrow never comes
until it's too late

You could be sitting
taking lunch

The news will hit you
like a punch

It's only Tuesday

What time is it?

You never thought
we'd go to war

After all the things
we saw

It's April Fools' day

What time is it?

Tomorrow never comes
until it's too late

Tomorrow never comes
until it's too late

You hear
a whistling overhead

Are you alive
or are you dead



It's only Thursday

What time is it?

You feel
a shaking on the ground

A billion candles
burn around

Is it your birthday

What time is it?

Tomorrow never comes
until it's too late

Trying to be smart

Get your ma on the phone

Tomorrow never comes
until it's too late

Trying to be smart

Think tomorrow's come
I think it's too late

Another day

Tomorrow is another day

Tomorrow is another day

Nice ride.

It does the job.

What job,
delivering pizzas?

Well, it's not the ride,
it's the rider.

What the hell
was that?

What?

Hey!
You talking to my girl?

Oh, shit. Here we go.
Yeah.

She was just
admiring my ride.

"My ride."

My grandma's Buick
could smoke

that piece of shit,
trailer trash.

Well, what about
your daddy's Viper?

This beast's
got 500 horsepower

and a Borla exhaust system.

It does 0 to 60
in like 4.3 seconds...

That's about right.
That's about right. Yeah.

Wow.
You can read the brochure.

What a pitch, baby.
What a pitch. I like that.

What's he gonna do?

Let's make it happen.
Bring it.

I got your...
I got your back.

Why don't you nice boys
let your cars do the talking?

I only race
for pink slips.

This car goes for 80 grand.

What would I do with a broken-ass
piece of shit like that?

How about me?

Winner gets me.

Cut it, let's cut it.
Let's go, go, go, go!

Blast-off, baby!

First one out
the other side...

It's time.
Let's go!

Ready, boys? Make it interesting, Clay.

Shit!

Yeah!

I thought
you loved me.

Oh, well.

What the hell?

Guess I got
a new date for prom.

Clay, stop the car!
Shut up!

Clay, stop the car!

Shut up!

Stop it!

Clay, please stop!
Please stop!

Can I get
a copy of that?

You think
this is a joke, huh?

You see Ken and Barbie
over there?

They're gonna walk out of here
without even a slap on the wrist.

Mommy and Daddy
are too hooked up.

But I like
screw-ups like you.

You know why?

'Cause you're 100%
guaranteed conviction.

Where's my car?
I crushed it.

You did what?

Sit down! You're done.
Easy, easy.

You're done. You
understand me? You're done.

And all before your eighteenth
birthday. Now sit down.

Sean.

What the hell were
you thinkin', huh?

Mrs. Boswell? Please.

It's, uh, it's Miss.

Officer, is it, um,
illegal to smoke in here?

It's a tough state.

And it's
a pretty clear-cut case.

He'll be lucky if they don't
try him as an adult.

This is our third town
in two years.

Your son's got two priors
for reckless driving,

willful destruction
of property.

This makes it
strike three.

They're definitely gonna want
to get him off the streets.

Well, there's
just got to be another way.

So, where are we
moving this time?

We are not
moving anywhere.

Sean.

I thought you were
gonna be here on the 7th.

Today is the 7th.

Well, look,
just hold on one second.

Come on in.

This is it.

You know, Sean, I was,
I was gonna be there.

But your mom,
she said the 7th, see,

and we're a day
ahead of you in Japan.

Well, you're here now,
and that's good.

So, how is your mom?

Where do I sleep?

Now, Sean, you know
she had no other choice.

I mean, it was
either this or juvie hall,

I mean, you just
can't keep moving away

every time
you get into trouble.

Worked for you.

Look, neither of us
asked for this.

But I promised your mom
I'd take care of you.

So you just go by the
rules her and I agreed to,

and I'm sure
you'll manage just fine.

Rules?

Yeah, rules. Real simple.

You go to school,

you come back here
right after.

And I don't
want to see or hear

about you
anywhere near a car.

Here,
the bedroom is yours.

Make yourself comfortable.

Lights out in 10.

You got to be kiddin'.

Wrong train.

I'm new here.

Boswell, yes, ma'am.

Japanese food
is like the Army.

Don't ask, don't tell.

Name's Twinkie.

Hey, I noticed
you ain't have a laptop.

Yeah?

I'll hook you up.
Half price.

No, I'm cool.

60% off. Hmm?

Since we're both army
brats and everything.

I ain't got no cash,
man.

And I ain't
an army brat.

All right, all right.

Well, what about
a cell phone, huh?

Everybody needs
a cell phone.

No offense,

but I'm probably
not gonna be here

long enough
to remember your name.

Then you gonna need some new
shoes to book town with, man.

You like Michael Jordan?

I love Michael Jordan.

Check this out.

Brand new Jordans.
Not even out yet.

LeBron James couldn't even
get his hands on those.

You selling that
Sparco steering wheel?

Hell, no.
That's mine right there.

Man, I even paid
retail for it.

What you drive?

My ride?
Yeah.

My ride's one of a kind.

Show me.

Thought you
weren't stickin' around.

All right.

My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh

My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh

Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh

My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh

My life be like

It's times like these
that make me say

Lord if you see me
please come my way

Leavin' bread crumbs
for when I stray

Rely on sacrifice
and the price you paid

Feel me like a fingertip

Slamming, huh?
Look at that car.

Tryin' not to quench your
fire with the things I do

At least let me drive.

Y'all better have some
real cars around here.

Okay, I see
somebody got jokes, huh?

Well, all right.

I don't know if you're
ready for them, though.

You look a little nervous.

What up, Tosh?

I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo

If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go

Tick, Tick, Tick

I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo

If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go

For when you
blow your wad, man.

Tick, Tick, Tick

Hear that?

It's still not right
for the way I drive.

I don't need a computer to tell
me about my throttle response.

Okay.
Then we're done here.

You wouldn't have
that problem with a V8.

Boys.

All they care about is
who's got the biggest engine.

I'm a guy.
It's in my DNA.

So y'all race
with these things, huh?

Cute little toys.

You know, I almost didn't recognize
you without your slippers on.

Don't you mean uwabaki?

Neela, right?

You're a quick learner.

So, where you from,
anyway?

Here.

No, I mean,
not where you live.

Where'd you come from?

Does it really matter
where I'm from?

Who's the tourist?

What's with you
and the schoolgirls, D?

You're moving up
in the world.

You gotta
elevate your company.

Wednesday, Wednesday,
meet Thursday.

God. Girl.

Ladies, hold that thought, all right?

All right, beautiful.
Hold up.

Hey!

He was just leaving.

I'm sorry.
I don't speak Japanese.

Understand that?
Gaijin?

Takashi.

We were just talking.

This isn't your scene.

That word you called me,
gaijin or something or other,

what does that mean
exactly?

Means, turn around,

keep walking.

That's exactly
what we gonna do.

Come on, man,
let's roll.

Yo, look, man,
he's yakuza.

Now, see, that's funny,

'cause I thought this
was, like, a free country

where a girl could talk
to whoever she wants.

You know who I am,
boy?

Yeah. You're like the Justin
Timberlake of Japan, right?

Leave.

Damn, man.
You know yakuza? The Mafia?

Look, sorry, DK- san.

Monkey didn't have
his banana today.

Hey, D, let's go.

It's time to race.

Hey, good luck, Timberlake.

You're the one that's lucky,
'cause I'm about to race.

Then let's race.

With what, huh?
Your skateboard?

Easy to sound cocky
when you got no ride.

Take mine.

Let's race.

What? I wanna see
what the kid's got.

Can he drive?

Can he drive?

You know what DK
stands for?

Donkey Kong?

Drift King.

Drift?

What do you mean,
drift?

Still need
a dictionary?

You know that
real famous painting?

The one of the woman
who's smiling all the time?

The Mona Lisa.

Right, right, right.
Mona Lisa.

Well, look, man,
this car right here's

like the Mona Lisa
of the drift world.

Han rebuilt this bad boy
from ground up.

We talking forged pistons,

bigger turbo,
new rods, new crankshaft.

Hey, man, Han's labor
ain't cheap, man, you feel me?

Well, if I needed a 30-second
lesson on how to drift...

All right, look, man, there's lots
of ways you can do this, all right?

Hand braking
is the easiest,

so the first thing
I want you to do,

I want you
to rip that e-brake.

All right,
after you rip the e-brake,

then I want you
to power over.

You know what?

Just don't mess up Mona,
all right?

All right.

Ready.

Set.

Go!

I told you.

Damn it!

Damn it!

Don't leave town.

Do you know
what time it is?

I thought
it was around 7:00.

You know,
US is a few hours behind.

Looks like the party
was better here, anyway.

Have you been racing, Sean?

You're out of here.

Go ahead.

You don't get it,
do you?

You have
nowhere else to go.

If it doesn't
work out here,

you're going to jail.
Do you get that?

This isn't a game.

And I'm gonna tell you
one more time,

if you're gonna
live under my roof,

you're gonna go by
my rules or get out.

Understand?

Understand?

Yes, sir.

Get in.

I'll get you your money.

Why you talking
like you have a choice?

There's a guy in there
with a paw

that owes me some money.

A paw?

Go get me my money.

Okay.

Han said,

okane.

Han said, okane.

Let's go.

You're in the pickup
and delivery business now.

I might call you once a week
or once an hour.

I don't care
if you're sick as a dog

or in bed with Beyonc?.

I call, you show.

Only if you teach me
how to drift.

This ain't a negotiation.

I wasn't negotiating.

What's he doing here?

He's paying me back for
that crumpled beer can

sitting in my garage.

Hope
he's not driving.

Gaijin.

When is your next race?

I'd really like to be there.

Why not be in it?

You heard me.

Ready to lose
another car, Han?

I'm ready to take that
'86 Corolla off your hands.

All right.

Put up the '72 Skyline.

Done.

What do you think,
Morimoto, huh?

Get him out of here.

We have business
to discuss.

Your shipment's late.

Since when are you
so worried about the details?

When is
the shipment arriving, Han?

Just sit pretty
and let me handle it.

Hey, Dad, it's me.

Uh, I had to
stay after school

for some
extracurricular activities.

So I'll be home
a little later.

Sir.

You really need to stop
following me around.

What are you
doing here?

I thought I'd stop by
and ask your boyfriend

for some drifting lessons.

Trust me.

You don't wanna be
a part of this world.

It's good enough for you.

You don't know
anything about me.

Well, why don't you
think I know?

'Cause I'm a gaijin?
An outsider?

Let me guess.

You're an army brat
who moved around a lot.

Your mama and daddy
was never home.

So you walked around
pissed off all the time.

And now you found your family
with these drift nuts.

Zero for one, cowboy.

Why can't you go find
a nice Japanese girl

like the rest of
the white guys around here?

Mamacita, oh my God,
I think your on fire

Do you want me
to get you water

Is everything okay
back there?

I can handle DK.

I thought he's yakuza.

His uncle's yakuza.

He's just playing gangster
in his little storage room.

But I need him.

He keeps Uncle Kamata
from poking around too much.

What do you mean?

Well, his uncle gets
a piece of the action

from everyone
on his turf.

We're on his turf.

50% of something
is better than

100% of nothing.

So have you raced DK?

Why not? Is he that good?

What's the point
of a race?

To see if I'm better
than the other guy.

Just proves you're faster,
that's all.

If I were to race,
it would have to be

for something important.

Or why else do it at all?

Why are you
letting me race?

'Cause you're
DK's kryptonite.

And you owe me a car.

She wanna break it down, break it
down, break it down, break it down

She want some reggaeton,
reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton

She wanna break it down, break it
down, break it down, break it down

She want some reggaeton,
reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton

Oh, shit.

I make ya smile right

What the...

Police cars here are
only factory-tuned.

You can do
better than 180 k,

they can't catch you,
so they don't even try.

'Cause its just nice you lookin
different sayin' to yourself

You know what?

I'm beginning to like
this country already.

When my chain keep linkin'
like Christmas lights

Mamacita, oh my God
I think your on fire

Do you want me
to get you water

Danny!

You're looking good.

Disco.

We gotta catch up.

Get you a drink on me, huh?

Let's go.

Aha. Easy now, ladies.

Come on.

Hey Mami, you sexy,
hey Mami, you sexy

What's up?
How you doing?

Hey, baby.

Hey Mami, you sexy,

Big hot pockets,

Skanky, cranky,
foogly, oogly

Slammin dudes
that wanna do me

G'Doonk G'Doonk,
skoonky, flavors

Keep your hands
off the kid, girls.

He's underage.

Country boys and them boys
in the city

Ladies, ladies, ladies.

Disneyland
for grownups, huh?

All these girls, man,
they look like...

What, models?

Check it out.

See,
Tokyo is the fashion capital

on this side of the planet,
all right?

Now, imagine
you been posing all day.

I mean,
that's a lot of hard work.

Not only do you get tired,
but, on top of that,

you wanna have a little fun,
but you can't

'cause you don't even know
nobody in town.

And most of
the guys around here are

too chicken shit
to even try picking up one.

So what do you do?

Man, you talk to the little
dude who makes you laugh.

Yeah.

Look, man, I don't just think
outside the box.

I tear it up.

That's my thing.

Yo.

You should
slow it down papi

You sound like
a carbon copy

Sean!

But you're
just plain sloppy

Hey Mami, you sexy

It's dipset Bitch

There it go
Baby don't stop now

There you go
Damn shorty look good

And I'm thinkin' about
gettin' at her

Okay,
time to whistle at her

Ay girl,
you make my whistle blow

There it go
Bring it here baby

There it go
Bring it here baby

Top down
and I'm at it again

It's hot now
and I'm at it to win

You heard me

Who want it with me

Nobody wanna it with me
Oh, I'm so fly

Oh, Mami, Back up

Move it till you feel
something hard on your back

The red Evo's yours.

If u want it come and get it
I ain't kiddin' I'm with it

Here it go, go

So, girl,
let me see you get low

There it go
Yeah, just like that

What do you mean?

You're representing
me now.

What you think, I'm gonna
let you roll in a Hyundai?

So, girl,
let me see you get low

Oh, man.

Damn it.

My mother,
she's blind in one eye

and she can drift
better than that.

Han,
where did you find this guy?

Will someone please teach
this guy how to drift?

Is that yours?

Sure is.

What happened?

I don't know. I found
it this way at the base.

It's got potential.

Yeah, maybe. We'll see.

You know, Sean,
the Japanese have a saying.

"The nail that sticks out
gets hammered."

You're gonna be late.

Sean!

Come on, man, you broke it.

Hey, whoa, whoa.

There must be
a misunderstanding.

Out of my way,
or you're next.

Take it easy.

Look, man, I don't
do refunds, all right?

Okay, let's go, then!
Let's go!

Touch me again...

Here.

Try not to break
this one.

Say, man!

What the hell is
wrong with you, huh?

Now everybody's gonna want
exchanges around here.

Damn!

Not easy saving the day,
is it?

Maybe you could give me
some pointers sometime.

You're doing
all right.

Thanks.

Hey.

Yeah?

Sorry about the other night.

Your life isn't
any of my business.

It's okay.

Foul!

Ain't no damn foul.
That was a foul.

Yo, you in my face.
That was a foul.

Hey, Han,
sort this wanker out.

A wanker?

What do I look like,
a zebra?

So, how did you end up
over here, anyway?

Well, you know
those old Westerns

where the cowboys
make a run for the border?

This is my Mexico.

Why'd you let me
race with your car?

You knew
I was gonna wreck it.

Why not?

'Cause it's a lot of money.

I have money.

It's trust and character
I need around me.

You know, who you
choose to be around you

lets you know
who you are.

And one car in exchange
for knowing

what a man's made of,

that's a price
I can live with.

Look at all those
people down there.

They follow the rules,
for what?

They're letting
fear lead them.

What happens if they don't?

Life's simple.

You make choices
and you don't look back.

So,
if you don't drift to win,

what do you drift for?

You really
want to know?

Yeah.

Okay. Let's go.

There's no "wax on,
wax off" with drifting.

Learn by doin' it.

The first drifters
invented drifting

out here in the mountains
by feeling it.

So feel it.

Again!

What's in this bag?

You'll see.

How much you got?

Keep going, keep going.

I'm so good, man, I could
sell rubbers to a monk.

Again.

Again.

Watch it. Watch it.
Not too early, now.

Go, go, go, go!

Don't lose it! Don't lose it!

Hey, Han.

Hey, Twink.
Get this man a bunk.

Pleasure doing business.

Yeah, baby. I told you.
I told you, didn't I?

It's actually not bad.

I didn't even have
to put ketchup on it.

See,
I'm not a total gaijin.

I hate that word.

It's what they used
to call me when I was a kid.

I thought
you were born here.

Well, "outsider" can mean
many different things.

My mom died when I was 10.

She came out here
from Australia

when she
finished high school.

And all I know
about her is that

she went to work
in a hostess bar.

DK's grandmother took me in.

Well, my parents
split up when I was three.

Me and Mom
moved around a lot.

Mostly 'cause of me.

Well,
it was all 'cause of me.

Kind of made myself
an outsider, you know,

without even
thinking about it.

But I realize now,

outsider or insider,
it doesn't really matter.

All that matters is knowing
what you really want

and going after it.

We used to come up here
when we were kids.

Even before we could drive
we'd cut class, sneak out,

come up here, and watch
the older kids drift.

Things were different
back then.

Once I got my license,
I practically lived up here.

Back then, kids just drove
whatever they had.

You know, we just made do.

No one bothered us.

The day I got my license

is the day I got
my first speeding ticket.

The day after that,
I won my first race.

I beat this rich kid
by three lengths.

I gotta admit, it felt good.

It felt like...

Like everything else
just disappears.

No past and no future.

No problems.

Just the moment.

Boy needs to chill.

Hey, Twink,
I'm gonna grab another set.

Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa! Another set?

No. Look, that was
your third set today.

I mean,
them tires ain't cheap.

DK, grab a chair.

We're about to
roast some marshmallows.

Yo, come on, man, look...

Stay away from her,

or the only thing you'll
be driving is a wheelchair.

Find yourself a new driver.

I'm all right.

What'd you expect?

You didn't just
play with fire,

you soaked
the matches in gasoline.

It's over.

All this over a gaijin?

I am a gaijin.

You've changed, DK.

You say I've changed.

But we're not so different,
you and I.

We're both products
of fuckups, aren't we?

They say your mom
was the best trick

in all of Kabukicho
back in the day.

Leave my mother
out of this.

If we hadn't taken you in,
you'd be just like her,

doing anything
for a buck.

Think anyone would take
a second look at you

if it wasn't
for your uncle?

We're the same, Neela.

Difference is I know who I am
and where I belong.

Do you know
who you are?

Do you know
where you belong?

Hey.

Come on.

Hey, brother.

I vouched for you!

Put my reputation
on the line for you!

We were partners!

You think you can keep
your side deals from me?

Come on.
We ain't in the Boy Scouts.

This is what we do.

Takashi!

What about now? Hmm?

Is this what we do?

Man, you need me.

You'd still be
shaking down teahouses

for chump change
if it wasn't for me.

Get in!

Go! Go! Go!

Come on.

Sean. Sean!

Takashi.

I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

Okay.

I'll go with you.

Neela.

See you when
Daddy's not around.

I'm putting you
on a plane tonight.

Dad...

Sean, don't argue with me.

I did this.
I can't run away.

I can't.

Sean,
I'm your father.

I'm responsible
for your well-being.

And I'm responsible
for my mess.

I gotta do this.

Can you understand that?

At least you're not
redoing my mistakes.

You all right, man?

We're leaving town.

Look, I know some people...

I can't do it, Twink.

Look, DK wants your head.

All right?

And the trouble you
just made for Kamata?

You're done here, bro.

Maybe I should
talk to Kamata.

What?

DK answers to him.

I know I just
didn't hear that.

I gotta end this.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

What, are you crazy, huh?

Han is dead, all right!

Plus, you can't just walk
into Kamata's place, man!

It's all I got.

Something I think Han
would've wanted you to have.

What's this?

You're gonna need it
if you're gonna make it

out of Kamata's place
alive.

Don't you need it?

No, it's cool.
Look, I'll figure it out.

Sean.

You need to leave.

You came to the wrong place.

I didn't come here
to see you.

Takashi.

You think

you can walk in here,
dump some cash and walk out?

I know I'm only returning
what belonged to you

in the first place, sir.

But that's not
why I really came.

I came here
to apologize.

I know your nephew and I have
embarrassed ourselves badly.

Sir, I'm here to offer you
a peaceful solution.

How do you plan
to accomplish that?

A race.

DK and I have caused
nothing but problems for you,

for us.

And I'm asking you
to allow us to settle this,

once and for all.

We race

and the loser leaves town
for good.

I've already beat
this piece of shit once!

Good.

Then it should be easy.

The cops
took all the cars.

Hey!

That's why she's spitting.

We almost there, Twink.

Couple more tweaks.

It's not the car
I'm worried about, man.

DK picked this road
for a reason.

This is his mountain.

He's the only one to ever
make it to the bottom.

Yeah!

Yeah!

Yes!

Come on.

Yeah! Come on!

Come on, Sean.

Let's go! Let's go!

Sean, you the boss. Let's go.

Damn! Come on, man!
That ain't right.

Yeah, baby!

That's what
I'm talking about, man.

I told you!

I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo

If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go

Fast and furious

Tick, Tick, Tick

Fast and furious

Tick, Tick, Tick

Hey, yo, Sean!
Yo, Sean!

Hey, check this out, man.

This dude over here
wanna race the new DK.

Heard he's been beating
everybody around Asia, too.

Not tonight, Twinkie.

Said he knew Han.

Said Han was family.

All right.

Let's race.

Nice ride.

I won it from my friend Han,
a few years ago.

I didn't know he was
into American muscle.

He was when
he was rolling with me.

You know this ain't
no 10-second race.

I got nothing but time.

You ready, kid?

Come on, Sean! Come on!

Ready!

Set!

Go!

You so crazy,
you so crazy

- Yeah, how about that, right there?

Right, right, right. Y'all see this?
Everybody take a real good look.

This is what you call mutual respect.
All right, let's clear out.

Anybody down for another race?

Shit.

Hey, make sure you bring that body
by the garage later

so we can work on that front end of yours.

Watch out.

Maybe I will.

Where are you going?

OFFICER: Yeah, this is him. We got him.

So, how long you been in South Florida?

- A while.
- Before that?

We know you're Brian O'Conner,
formerly of the LAPD.

- Man, You got the wrong guy.
- Really?

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

How you doing, O'Conner?

Let's take a walk.

MARKHAM: Carter Verone.

Born in Argentina,
but he's lived most of his life in Miami.

Now he owns the biggest
import-export business in the state.

You see, unfortunately, the cartels have
been successful getting drugs into Miami.

But they've had a hard time
getting the cash out.

We've been surveilling him for a year.

But we've never been able to put him
and the money together.

- We've swept his house, his warehouses...
- Nothing.

Customs here has done a great job
of getting us this far.

I'm just here to help get them over the top.

I was able to get an agent in undercover,

working travel and logistics for him.

Recently Verone put her in charge
of finding some new drivers.

Right, although we can't confirm
her status right now.

- You think she's flipped?
- She's one of mine. She's all right.

She's been in with Verone nearly a year.
Even lives at the compound with him now.

Look, it was the FBI's idea
to bring you in here. I'm against it.

But we need some good drivers that can
put this asshole and his money together.

You're gonna roll with Agent Dunn here.

And if I don't?

Here's a list of the laws you broke in L.A.

Obstruction of justice, aiding and abetting.
You know the rap sheet.

We can make this all go away
in the interest of justice

if you're willing to play ball.

So what's the idea here? Dunn and I
are supposed to be street racers?

That's right.

(SLURPING)

So, Dunn,

looks like we're going to be partners, bro.

Could you tell me,
what would be a better motor

for my Skyline, a Gallo 12 or a Gallo 24?

(CLEARING THROAT)

Twenty four.

I didn't know pizza places made motors.

See, man, come on, I can't do this.

I mean, seriously,
if this is what you're gonna give me,

I may as well take my chances in Chino.

BILKINS: We'll get someone else.

BRIAN: No way, man.

The only way I'll do this is
if I get to pick the driver.

(BILKINS SIGHING)

All right, O'Conner. Who you got in mind?

- This dude I grew up with in Barstow.
- Who's that?

Roman Pearce.

(ENGINE REVVING)

(EXCLAIMING)

- That your boy in the Monte Carlo?
- BRIAN: Yeah, that's him.

Yeah, he's got some skills.

And he's crazy as hell, I'm telling you.

In a good way, though.
He's the man for the job.

And he's got quite a record,
including three years upstate.

Says here, he's on house arrest now.

Can't go more than
100 yards from his home.

(ANNOUNCER CHEERING ON PA)

(ANNOUNCER WHOOPING)

(MUMBLING)

He always said he'd be famous.

BRIAN: Pearce!

Roman Pearce!

Yo, whatever happens next, just let it go.

I ain't in it.

(WHISTLES)

Rome!

Only my homeboys call me Rome,

Pig.

- I'm not a cop anymore, bro.
- Is that true?

Blondie here is not a cop anymore?

That's true. No badge.

BILKINS: Here we go.

(BRIAN AND ROME GRUNTING)

You still fight like shit.
You still fight like shit.

You better chill.

- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm gonna choke you.

I told you to stay away from me.

(BRIAN AND ROME GRUNTING)

You should have told me.
I did three years, Brian.

I told you it wasn't my fault.

Why did you come here, O'Conner?

I got a deal for you.

When I needed your ass,
you were nowhere to be found.

Now you're trying to hand out deals?

I need you to come to Miami
and drive with me.

If you do, they'll take off that anklet
and they'll clear your entire record.

I did three years in jail.

Three years in jail over you, Brian.

- I know you better than you think.
- Maybe you don't.

Maybe you don't.

You guys finished?

This deal legit?

That's right. If you do this job for us.

- I told you.
- Shut up, punk.

So you're gonna clean my record
and get this thing off my ankle.

That's right.

I thought you couldn't wander
more than 100 yards from your home.

Why do you think
I'm parked so close to the derby?

Man, quit playing
like you're gonna pass this up.

You stupid...

Wait. Hold on.

Bro, what's going on?

I don't know if
I should be trusting you, man.

Just think of it this way.
It's an opportunity for a fresh start.

Now, let's just go do this, all right?

I wouldn't need a fresh start
if it wasn't for you.

Man, you've been using that
since the day you got busted.

- Now, let's just chill out and go do this.
- I don't need to chill out.

Yes, you do. And you need to stop
blaming me for your every mistake.

And Roman Pearce needs to start taking
responsibility for his own actions.

- You need to go to hell.
- And you need to go back to Barstow.

I'm not going back to Barstow.

Brian O'Conner, Roman Pearce,
meet Monica Fuentes.

- Do they have background on Verone?
- They've been briefed.

MONICA: Good. All right, here's the deal.

Verone's looking for drivers.
I've arranged for both of you to join up.

I've also hired some thugs,
you know, to make it legit.

- When do we start?
- Right now.

What are we driving?

(ROME WHOOPING)

ROME: Don't even think about
taking the convertible.

It might loosen your mousse.

BRIAN: That's cool.
That's too much chrome for me anyways.

ROME: Damn! Where do you all
confiscate these rims from, man?

Check in with us after you meet him.

You think you're gonna have any problems
with these two knuckleheads?

I can handle them.

If they give you any trouble at all,
you let me know.

Thanks, Markham.

I ride with you, cowboy.

- ROME: Why she gotta ride with you?
- You get the convertible. Let's go.

Turn right here.

- So, you used to be a cop?
- Yeah.

How long you been under?

I lost track.

You all right?

You might want to keep
your eyes on the road, playboy.

- What, you think we're gonna crash?
- I haven't decided yet.

(ENGINE REVVING)

What are you doing, Brian?

(TIRES SCREECHING)

He did the "stare and drive" on you,
didn't he? He got that from me.

MONICA: Once we get in here,
you're on your own.

Look at that one.

Where'd you get them cars?
At the bottom of a cereal box?

Real funny, Fonzie.

Ass.

Roberto, Enrique,
I need pictures of the drivers,

their license plates, their cars,
and anything else you can find.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

(WHISTLES)

Let's go.

Keep your mouth shut
and follow my lead, all right?

- I got this.
- No, I'm serious now.

Handle your business. I'll handle mine.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

Watch your hands, bruh.

ENRIQUE: Go in line.

Let's go.

Carter.

- The drivers are here.
- Good.

Come on.

Stay.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

What's going on here, bro? Tell me.

VERONE: Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

My red Ferrari was confiscated yesterday

and it sits in an impound lot in Little Haiti.

It's about 20 miles from here.

The car isn't important. What is important
is the package I left in the glove box.

The first team back here with the package

will have an opportunity to work for me.

What are you saying? We got to audition?

Nobody's got a gun to your head.

That's it.

Driver's licenses. Pass them up.

Before Christmas, guys.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

MAN: Let's go!

Come on, cuz!

All right, let's see what this thing can do.

(HORN BLARING)

Agent Markham.
I've got them heading south on I-95.

Yeah, I got it.

They're running. What a surprise.

Come on, stick with me, Rome.
What you got?

Why must I chase the cat?

Smart-ass.

Oh, yeah, you think you're the bomb, Rome?

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(MAN SCREAMING)

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(EXCLAIMING)

Let's see if you still got it, Brian.

All right, Rome,
I got something for your ass.

Watch this, bro.

Shit.

Damn, Rome, how do you like them apples?

Show-off!

That's the Brian O'Conner
school of driving right there, baby!

Crazy-ass white boy!

Shit!

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING)

MAN: Bumbaclot.

WOMAN: You better get yourself
out of the street!

That's some bad shit, man.

What do we got?

That's good. Show me his partner.

Cars, cars. Where are the cars?

Stinking boats. Where are the cars?

Come on, I need the cars.
Where are the cars at?

- Look in the center. Look in the center.
- What?

Cha-ching!

- Now put your blouse back on.
- Hater.

(CARS APPROACHING)

ROME: Shit!

- Don't let him get away.
- Not a problem.

Sit on it, Fonzie!

(POLICE SIREN WAILS)

What the hell?

Shit. Cops.

ROME: What the hell are they doing here?

BRIAN: Rome, no!

Time to go.

Son of a bitch!

MONICA: Juvy record for popping cars.
Two years in J.D.

Then another year for aiding and abetting
an armed robbery.

He's clean. Dirty, but clean.

All right.

Hey, man. You got something
to eat up in there?

We hungry.

Sit them by the pool.

Nice. Come on.

- What are you checking her out for?
- I'm not checking her out.

- Yes, you were.
- No, I wasn't.

- I seen you checking her out, man.
- Okay, I was. Now shut up.

You shut up. Don't tell me to shut up.

Both you girlies shut up. Unbelievable.

You sure are cozy in this big old mansion.

Sleeping with the enemy.

No, no, no, no. Sit down.

Nice Ferrari you got in the driveway.

I'm glad you like it.

Darling, will you hold that?

We did all that for a damn cigar?

No. You did that for a job.

Do you really think that
I would let somebody impound my car?

The boatyard is mine.

By the way, you two owe me a gate.

I'll just take it off your cut.

(SCOFFS)

- Off our cut?
- Yeah.

- I like that.
- Good.

What's this job you got for us, anyway?

Come with me.

The house has ears in it.

I have something I want you to carry
from North Beach to the Keys.

What is it?

Just put in the car what I tell you to
and drive it to me

and don't let anybody stop you.
Understand?

Yeah. Any chance of cop trouble?

No, I'm buying you a window of time,
but it's not gonna be open very long.

You make it,

and I'll personally hand you
$100,000 at the finish line.

Make it $100,000 a piece, papi.

Look, man,

obviously

your pockets ain't nervous.

- Don't ever touch me.
- Ours are empty.

Like I said,

we hungry.

I got an idea. Why don't you two boys
join us at the club a little later tonight?

Yeah. Pearl at midnight?

- Get to know each other a little bit better.
- That sounds good.

- We'll see you tonight.
- See you.

Hey, you!

- Your pockets aren't empty.
- Damn.

I'll take my cutter back.

BRIAN: Stupid ass.

Hey, man, I figured you
had like 12 or 13 of these

You're not too bright, are you?
Just get out of here. Get out of here.

Same old Rome
doing the same old stupid shit.

Get off me, man.

Look, running your mouth?
Insulting people? Stealing Verone's shit?

You think I'm gonna let somebody
stare me down?

I didn't let nobody
stare me down in jail, homeboy.

You think I'm gonna let it fly on a beach?

"And you, I'll take my cutter back."

His rich ass.

- And you're packing.
- Like you ain't.

Exactly.

- From here on out, I do the talking.
- You want to do more than that.

What's that supposed to mean?

It means you're always getting in trouble
over a female, Brian.

BRIAN: Man, Tej's garage is ridiculous.
He's got the best of everything.

Snap-on tools. All these lifts are brand new.
They're only maybe a couple of months old.

- Hey, yo, Jimmy. What's up, man?
- JIMMY: Hey, what up, Bullitt?

That's Rome right there. Do me a favor.

When you get a second, I want you
to check out the Evo and Spyder.

Make sure everything's copasetic.

Evo? Where'd you get an Evo from?

- It's a long story.
- I got you, man.

- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Come check this out.

Man, it's so hot and humid,
I can't even wear drawers.

Man, tell me about it.

Look at all this potential out here.

Ray, don't do that, man.
You're making me lose money.

Come on, stop that.
I know you're better than that. Come on.

Damn.

(CROWD CHEERING)

(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)

Girl, you know your boy can help you
put that fire out! Look at the bubble on that.

- Let's go.
- ROME: That's serious.

TEJ: Come on, Ray,
you're making me lose money.

Don't do that. Don't do that to me right now.

Come on, Ray. Do it.

Tej Parker? This is Roman Pearce.

Basically, he's the man to know in Miami.
He's got his finger in absolutely everything.

- It's just the way it is.
- Come home to daddy. Come on now.

- What's going on, Suki?
- What's up, baby?

- How you doing?
- I'm good. How you doing?

What's this? What's the latest?

It's a work in progress. It's not finished yet.

That's some artistic shit.
You got talent, girl.

Ray, it's do or die right now!
Bring it home, Ray! Bring it home, Ray!

Yeah, baby!

Pay up! Pay up! Pay up!

Pay up, everybody.

That's how they do it out here, man?

- Every day.
- That's crazy.

Right here. Right now.
What's up, man? You don't look too happy.

Expeditiously, man. I need it quick.
What's up? Thank you. Thank you.

How you feeling, man? You all right?
Thank you.

Not too bad.

I see you're about your money, homey.
You race, too?

No, man. I hit a wall doing
like a buck 20 a couple years ago.

Ever since then, I've just been
organizing and collecting, man.

Hey, Tej, check it out.
He's gonna be in town for a while.

Is there any way he could use that cot?

- What's wrong with your place, man?
- No.

I don't want to stay with him.
He got bad habits.

All right, man, whatever. Show him around.
I'll be up there in a minute.

- Thanks.
- Sure.

All right, who wants a chance
to win their money back?

So, Jimmy? So, what's up,
you ever seen anything like this before?

No. Both of them
are wired like I never seen before.

What?

Yeah, man, they got us wired with GPS.

That's why Markham knew
we were gonna be at that impound lot.

Yo, you the master mechanic.
Why don't you just yank that shit out?

I'll try, but this ain't LoJack.

The DIS box, the engine management
system, hell, the main harness,

the GPS is spidered into all of that.

Hey, tell me something, man.

Do I even want to know
where the Skyline is, dawg?

Or where you've been
the past couple of days

or where the hell you got these rides from?

- They're hot.
- Yeah, they hot.

They wired so hot that
whoever's tracking these things

would know every time
you don't wear your seat belt.

All right, Jimmy.

- Just do what you can do, bro.
- I got you.

Thanks, man.

Man, we need to get these
on the street ASAP.

Hey, bro, check it out.

See that Cadillac across the street
over there?

Yeah.

Yeah, well, they've been on us
ever since we left Verone's house.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

Elian and Fidel!

Hey, man,
can I clean your windshield, buddy?

What are you doing, man?

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

ROME: Is everything copastetic, homey?

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

Kiss my ass.

Shit.

ROME: Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

(CURSING IN SPANISH)

He's gonna blow our cover
before we even get started.

- Bilkins, tell me what went wrong?
- That's what I want to know.

Show me your hands.
Come on, keep them up!

- What's this about, man?
- What's going on?

Hold this. You think you can shoot at me?
I'm a goddamn federal agent.

What are you talking about?

Get your damn hands off me!
Get him away from me, dawg!

Just 'cause you wear a badge doesn't mean
you can mess shit up for us, homeboy!

Get your hands off me!

- You're lucky I didn't shoot you!
- Shut up!

Don't tell me to shut up, Brian!

- You almost blew our cover, old man!
- MARKHAM: I'm right here.

You shouldn't have shown up like you did.

You didn't know Verone was testing us?

- No, I thought you punks were running!
- Running?

That's great. That's real great!

And if Rome wanted to shoot you?
You wouldn't be here right now.

All right, we got to get this under control.

That's mine!

So?

- Tell me what you know.
- Rome and I will be making a run for Verone.

I'm not sure when or where,

but he did say that he bought us a window,
I'm assuming from the local cops.

I can talk to some of the guys
at the local P.D.

No. No good. If Verone's got some of them
on the payroll,

then we can't let them know our operation.

Exactly.

In addition, Verone told us that
he himself would be waiting at the drop.

That's good news.

If you're gonna be delivering drug money
to him, then we can get him for laundering.

- Now, there's only one problem.
- What's that?

Fuentes.

- Verone's tapping her.
- Tapping her?

- Tapping her how?
- That is crap.

Now what you talking about, homeboy?
We know what we seen.

So what do you think, O'Conner? You think
she's compromised? You should know.

- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your old pal O'Conner didn't tell you?

He flipped on Bilkins in L.A.

He gave his mark his car keys
and let him disappear.

That's why he's not a cop anymore.

So what do you think, expert?

Man, I don't know.

All right. We'll keep an eye on her.

We're out of here.

Let your man go?

Drop it. I don't wanna talk about it.

Drop it, hell.
I want to hear about this, homey.

I said, forget about it, cuz.

We got Fuentes in with Verone,

Markham trying to blow our cover,

and we got two wired cars that are no better
than that damn ankle bracelet of mine.

I'm gonna tell you, bruh, you let Markham
do that shit again in front of Verone,

that's gonna be our ass!

I know, man. I know.
It's just getting thick real quick.

We may need a way out, we got to come up
with some kind of an exit strategy.

- Exit strategy?
- Yeah.

I like the way that sounds.
What you got in mind?

I don't know, man.
But we need two more cars.

Yeah. Here they come.

Fonzie and Fabio. Glad you can join us.

We heard you boys wanted to get rid
of those Cracker Jack toys.

No, actually we just figured
those cars you got

deserve better drivers, which is why
we're gonna take them off your hands.

You know, why don't we settle this now?

Wait, wait, wait. How about we settle
this on the blacktop?

Each car does a down-and-back,
tag-team style. For slips.

Loser walks home.

- We came to race.
- Load them up then.

Come on, bro, let's get these cars.

All right, check it out. There's no way
we're gonna beat these guys straight up.

That Hemi's putting out about 425

and that Yenko will snap
a speedo in about five seconds flat.

We're gonna have to pull something
out of our ass.

The only thing I can think of is save
the spray for the way back.

The return trip.

- Done deal.
- All right, let's do this, bro.

I'm getting that orange one.

(ROME LAUGHS)

You ain't ready, Fabio!

TEJ: All right.

You each got a barrel to go around
down at the end of the road here.

Second wave's got to sit tight till
your partner crosses this line right here.

First team to go down and back twice
wins the race.

At which point,

the losers will hand over them keys.

Otherwise you'll be eating breakfast
through straws from now on.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

I get it.

This means you, too.

I got it.

All right. Let's race.

(ENGINES REVVING)

Come on, baby, you got this, Rome!
This dude ain't serious.

Yeah, you gone, homey.
I got this. This is done.

You about to lose your car.

- Do it, Rome!
- Come on, bitch, you got it, man.

You think I'm worried about this fool, man?
This is nothing!

(ENGINE REVVING)

(ENGINE ROARING)

- Oh, no.
- American muscle.

Your engine ain't as big as your mouth.

Got to smoke him.
Got to smoke him, got to smoke him.

All right, here we go!

- It's all right, baby, I'm gonna handle this.
- Handle it.

Ready, and go!

(TIRES SCREECHING)

You ain't ready! I run these streets!

(WHOOPING)

Romey Rome! You ain't heard of me?

Oh, shit.

(CHEERING)

I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.

Where's your big mouth now?

That car's going home with me, homey.

(NITROUS OXIDE HISSES)

Shit. Eat this, sucker!

Shit!

(ENGINE REVVING)

Yeah, boy! Go, Korpi!

Sorry, blondie, how does that dust taste?

I don't know.

Come on, Rome.

What the...

Good move, kid.
Let's see if you got the balls. Come on.

(WHOOPING)

Come on, Brian, bring it home, man!

We got two new cars!

Damn!

Y'all ain't ready, homeboy!
Get to walking, Fabio!

ROME: Use them bus tokens, partner!

- BRIAN: Hey, how you doing?
- Good. What's your name?

We're guests of Mr. Verone's.

(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)

It's a hoasis in here, bruh.

Yeah, lots of potential.

Damn. You got a pen?

It's about to get serious, bruh.

Look at that girl on the swing right there.

Hey, you guys did something right.
Verone never socializes with hired help.

Now what's that make you?

- Where's he at?
- He's on his way.

You and Verone
don't go everywhere together?

- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

- I'm gonna go take a piss.
- You go do that.

What is his deal?

He doesn't trust people who carry badges.

So you talk like you know.

I'd been a cop about two months
when Roman was busted in a garage raid.

He had eight sets of wheels
in his possession, each one of them hot.

So you busted him?

No, I didn't even know it was going down.
But that doesn't really matter to him.

Basically, once I became a cop, Roman saw
me as a friend who became the enemy.

Is there anything I can get for you,
Mr. Verone?

VERONE: Just tell them to come join me.

Oh, yeah. I was admiring this.

Damn.

- I wasn't about to give it to you.
- Good.

- What's up?
- He's here, man.

Where's he at?

He's over there. Don't look.

Excuse me, Mr. Verone
would like for you to join him.

Let's do it.

See what I'm talking about?

VERONE: It's all right, let them in.

Go sit down, I'll talk to you in a second.

- BRIAN: How you doing?
- Good. Enjoying your night?

- Yeah, I'm having a good time.
- Good, good.

She's beautiful, isn't she?

Yeah.

She's gorgeous.

You got balls, kid.

I can appreciate that.

Women are a very powerful force.

You see the blonde sitting
with the gentleman right here?

Five minutes of her time, and she
can get anything she wants from him.

I love your hair.

Watch.

I wonder where they're going? Sit down.

So you lit my man's car on fire.
Is that right?

Yeah.

I did.

You see, I got a problem with authority.

I have that same problem.

For me, it's cops in particular.

(CHUCKLING)

Let's take a walk. Come on.

- We just got here.
- And now we're leaving.

Let's go.

Come on.

What's all that?

We're going to have a little fun.

(CHAMPAGNE FIZZLING)

(GLASS CLINKING)

Thank you.

- It'll be fun. Let's stay longer.
- Let's get out of here.

Hey, Carter.

Meet Detective Whitworth.

One of Miami's finest.

Thank you, sweetheart.

You enjoying yourself, Detective?

Yeah, I was.

I mean, you know me.

Yeah.

I do know you.

You've been on my payroll a long time.

- Verone, that ain't right.
- Shut up.

I've got one last job for you, Detective.
You hear me?

- Look, we've been all through this.
- Yeah?

Yeah, and I said I can't do it.

That's the wrong answer. The table.

(WHITWORTH GROANS)

I'm a detective, Verone!

You do anything to me, the whole
force is gonna be on your ass in a minute.

Shut your mouth, you fat piece of shit.

Stop right now.

(RAT SQUEAKING)

What the hell? What the hell is that?

Sit down.

You're going to regret this. Stop right now!

Once the bucket
gets hot enough, Detective,

the rat is gonna want out.

And the only direction it can go, is south.

Hold that.

Get it off me!

Shut up.

Did you know that your average rat
can chew through a steel drainpipe?

You see, you have nothing to worry about
when he's screaming, Detective.

It's when he goes quiet
that he goes to work.

WHITWORTH: Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

You can't be this stupid! Stop it now!

You're in charge of the units
that are watching my properties.

What I want is, I want a 15-minute window

where everybody, and I mean everybody,
disappears. You hear me?

- I can't do it!
- You can't?

(WHITWORTH SOBBING)

WHITWORTH: Stop it.

Okay. Monica, come here.

WHITWORTH: Help! Help!

Shut him up. Shut him up.

Help!

(SQUEALING)

(SCREAMING)

It's biting me!

(MUFFLED SHOUTING)

What?

Got something you want to say?

It bit me. Jesus.

- WHITWORTH: I'll do it!
- Do what? Say it.

I'll do it. I'll give you your window.

Just get it off me.

Get it off!

You betray me,

and my rat here

is gonna visit your wife, Lynn,

your son, Clay, and your daughter, Lexi.

Do you hear me? Do you understand me?

- You hear me?
- Get it off.

I'll burn your fucking eyes out!
I'll burn them out.

Now, you can go.

- Get rid of him. Let's go.
- Get it off.

You boys enjoy the show?

Fifteen minutes, and then every cop
in Florida's gonna be on you.

Be at Versailles Cafe at 6:00 a.m.,
day after tomorrow, ready to drive.

- You understand?
- Yeah.

Don't play games with me

or you'll be next. All right?

Help yourself to a little champagne.
Let's go.

That was a damn rat, man.

You ever touch another man again,
and I'll kill you.

You hear me?

Look at me. You hear me?

ROME: She was into it, man.
What's that about?

You seen the way she grabbed
the dude's head.

She had to, man. He was testing her.

You got to remember,
her ass is on the line, just like ours.

You're feeling this girl way too much.

She's like that crazy-ass trailer rat
from back in the day, Tanya.

Tanya? Man, you went out with her
after I did.

I mean, I couldn't let it go to waste.

JIMMY: I got you. I got you. I got you.

Is that right?

We go race for cash,
but when I step on the gas,

my nitrous go blast,
leave your ass in the past.

Tej, you about to lose your garage.

Whatever, man.

I'm a low-budget mechanic,
but I overcharge.

Pay me! Let's go, man.

Pay me my money. I told you, man.

I'm glad you're happy man. I'm so glad.
This is my garage, boy.

Royal flush. Give me this, man.

You got to talk to him, talk to him.

Damn, you can't play and play it for long.

Put that money back on the table.
You know it's mine next hand.

Jimmy, how are you gonna pay me back
if you keep losing to Tej like that?

- How you doing, bro?
- Real good.

I'm going to crash, Tej.
I'll catch you tomorrow.

What are you doing here?

Brian, they're gonna kill you.
I heard him telling Enrique and Roberto.

Once you finish the run,
they're putting a bullet in your head.

You sure you heard him right?

I'm sure. I'm sure.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

Verone's boys is outside...

I see what they're looking for.
Your little girlfriend here.

- They don't know I'm here. I snuck out.
- What the hell are they doing here then?

I don't know. Maybe they're guessing.

Go stall them.
Go stall them for, like, two minutes.

Check her, homey. Check her.

Found what you're looking for?

Hey, buddy. Hi, guys. How you doing?

Y'all still mad about y'all car?

Don't even trip, homey.
Come on, man, can't you take a joke?

All right, this isn't about being a good cop
any more or doing your job.

They're gonna kill you.
You guys gotta pull out.

Verone pay y'all
to keep a straight face like that?

'Cause if I was making money, shit,
I'd get that mole removed off my damn nose.

- Okay?
- Yeah.

How much he pay y'all anyway?

Every time I see y'all, man,
y'all got the silk shirts on,

jewelry, you know, looking real Miami.

I caught you walking up in the club,
you got the hamburger meat all hanging out.

Don't make that run, Brian.
Don't make that run.

Be careful.

(ROBERTO SPEAKING SPANISH)

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

Where are you going?
You stay right here with us, buddy.

Don't even think about it.

Stay your ass off my homeboy's boat.

(ENRIQUE GROANS)

Put the gun down! Put the gun down now!

You first, asshole! You first!

I'll shoot the shit out of him!
Now, put the gun down!

(YELLING IN SPANISH)

Put down the gun now!

Put down the gun!

Enough. Enough.

Shut up. Shut up.

It's over. Come on.

It's over. Let's go.

It's our gun. Come on, let's go. Let's go.

I'm glad to see you boys
are getting along so well

because tomorrow, Roberto and Enrique
are gonna be riding along with you.

Just so we don't have any problems.

I'll see you guys in a bit.

What the hell was she doing in there, man?

Where'd you go this morning?

I went to breakfast with some friends.

With friends?

(CHUCKLES)

I do have friends, Carter.

(CHUCKLES)

Okay.

I'll see you later.

Nice shirt, Bilkins.

- It's my day off.
- Yeah.

Well, anyhow, this is the deal.

Last night, Verone threatened a cop
into giving us a window.

We're driving to an airstrip
in the Keys, off Nallwood Avenue.

Verone has a plane there
and he's taking off for good.

Wait a minute. How do you know this?

Monica.

She's doing her job. She warned us.

She warned you about what?

Verone plans to kill us
after we give him the money.

Driving into an ambush was never
part of the deal. I'm calling this off.

Like hell you are.
This is a Customs case, Bilkins.

No one's calling this off unless I do.

Look, this is real simple.

You make the run, you get Verone and his
cash together so I can move in for the bust.

You don't, I'll file enough charges
on both of you to make you disappear.

Take these.

We're gonna have GPS on you the
whole time so you don't get any cute ideas.

And to make sure
nothing happens to them, right?

Yeah, right.

ROME: That guy's a dick, man.

BRIAN: Yeah.

Let me get this right.

If we don't do this, then we go to jail.

But if we do it,
then Verone's going to kill us.

- It's a hell of a deal, huh?
- Yeah.

Maybe it is.

I know this guy's got an ass full of loot
that he's ready to dump in our cars.

And I can think of two reasons why
Verone doesn't need that money any more.

Here we go.

You and me.

Just like the old days.

What do you think?

I think they messed with
the wrong two guys, that's what I think.

- Yo, Tej, what's up, bro?
- What up?

Hey, man, how quickly can you organize?

TEJ: Look, if y'all really want
to carry out this plan,

this is definitely the best place to do it.
So what do y'all think, man?

I think it's perfect.
So, what do they store here?

Man, this thing is clean.

Distributor cap.

Jimmy, do we have any half-empty
bottles of nitrous lying around?

Sure, but I've already loaded you for spray.

No, I'm thinking we may need it
for something else

'cause our cars may get
a little crowded, you know?

Man, when did you start eating so much?

I was in jail, bruh.

I know how shitty the grub is on the inside.

With the way things are shaping up
out here right now,

it'll be a matter of time
before I'm back in there, or dead.

So I'm trying to eat all I can while I can.

Plus, the doctor tells me
I got a high metabolism.

Man, you remember us growing up?

You know, playing football in the dirt?

You know, getting into trouble.
All the stupid things we did?

When you got busted, you know,
whether I was a cop or not,

you know, if there was anything
I could have done,

you know, I would have done it.

I just want you to know that.

Is that why you let that dude go in L.A.?

Yeah, I think that had a lot to do with it.

When I got busted

it wasn't your fault.

It was all on me, Mr. Roman Pearce.

Wild and out. Crazy man.

No one could tell me nothing.

Riding solo.

Yeah, well, not anymore.

Not anymore, bro.

I've got Verone's Navigator
leaving the residence.

Copy.

Sir, we've got Verone on the move
to the airstrip.

Good. Let's get a bird in the air.
Tell him to keep his distance.

AGENT 1: Ready to go.
AGENT 2: Thanks.

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

- You're all set.
- Thanks.

- All set?
- Yeah. Let's do it.

Report.

What's going on out there?

Team One, checking in.

- Team Two, checking in.
- Team Three, checking in.

AGENT: Team Four, all clear here, too.

AGENT 1: Team Five, checking in.

AGENT 3: Team Six, all clear.

ROME: Here we go.
BRIAN: Yeah, so you know what to do.

BRIAN: Stay cool. Keep focused.

Remember the airstrip's
off Nallwood Avenue.

It's the third exit after the bridge.

Got it.

So, what up, man, you ready for this?

Come on, man.
Guns, murderers, and crooked cops?

I was made for this, bruh!

ROBERTO: Come on.

(TAPPING ON DOOR)

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

I got activity at Verone's trailer property.

Do not move an inch until I tell you to!

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

Load up.

All units,

move on the trailer property.
Right now! Move!

(POLICE SIRENS WAILING)

Shit. Local P.D. is moving in on our guys.

- Three bags in one car?
- Guess so.

(POLICE SIRENS WAILING)

(HELICOPTER APPROACHING)

The cops.

I'm not going back to jail.

Where are you going, man?
Let's go! Let's go!

What is he doing?

Okay, now let's get the chopper over them.
I want eyes right on top.

You got it.

Lima 2-5,

follow GPS.

Do you know what you're doing, man?

Stay with me, Rome. Stay with me.
Come on, man.

FEMALE PILOT: I've got them
heading south on I-95.

Bring in the aerial ESDs.

(SIRENS WAILING)

Oh, shit!

- They're catching up, man!
- Shut up, man!

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Nice driving, Rome, nice driving.

I got you, Brian.

Check it out!

What was that?

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Oh, shit!

- Come on, man. Take the wheel.
- No, no, no, no. I can't drive.

- Just hold the wheel! Put your hands on it.
- I can't drive!

Just hold it steady. Just like that.

What are you doing, man?

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

(GRUNTING)

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(YELLING IN SPANISH)

Yeah, man!

Hold.

Bilkins, the bird's in place.

Yeah.

We've got Verone's Navigator.

All right. Money's in transit. Sit tight.

You're a good driver, man.

Thanks, bro.

We've got the area blocked ahead.
They've got nowhere to go.

What was that?

MALE PILOT: I've got a visual.

Video should be coming through.

I got it. Looks good.

Where are they going?

Shit.

All right, Miami's finest,
let's see what you got.

Come on. Stay with me, boys.

Hey, man, everyone's here.
Time for the show.

Let's give it to them.

All right, let the party begin. Let's go!

This is unit 25-99.
We have the suspects surrounded.

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO)

(ENGINES REVVING)

(WHOOPING)

(MAN YELLING IN SPANISH)

Holy shit!

It's a scramble, baby! A big one!

Yeah! Let's do this!

Check this out.

We're not tracking them on video.

We must have lost them in the scramble.

Yo, let's break.

Yeah!

(YELLING IN SPANISH)

All right, we got them going west on Beach.

Roger that! I've got them!

Customs has a fix on two cars
going west on Beach.

OFFICER: Roger. Follow those cars.

Roger that.

Shit.

They're cornered.

OFFICER: Keep your hands
where I can see them!

Hands up!

Whoa, fellas, fellas, I know my tags
are out of date, but damn.

What the hell?

Where are they?

(WHOOPING)

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

How about them apples, man?

Yeah! That's some driving
for your ass, baby!

Ain't that some driving for your ass?

Good job, man.

- What are you talking about, man?
- Whatever, man.

You're supposed to be a stone-faced killer!

You over there were grabbing your seat belt!

Hey, Tej, thanks a lot, bro.
Man, you're clutch. I owe you one big time.

Yeah, Brian, you really do owe me, man.
You really do...

Us.

Suki says you owe us, all right?

- Yo, Rome, you there, man? Come in.
- What's up, man?

It looks like we got just one more trick left.

My pleasure, buddy! Let's do it, baby!

Maybe we should grab Verone
while we still can.

No! Not yet!

What?

You lost them?

Shit!

Those little pricks are running!

It's your call. What do you want to do?

We're gonna take him down.
He is not leaving here.

Enjoying the ride?

Man, it's a fast car, huh?

It's a classic. Old school.

American muscle.

Man, this car can do all kinds of things.
Want to see?

(ROME LAUGHING)

Check this out right here, homey.

Hey, what are you doing, man?

(ROBERTO GROANING)

(NITROUS OXIDE HISSING)

(WHOOPING)

(YELLING)

Ejecto seato, cuz!

It worked! I love this button!

ROME: Stay on your toes!

Mr. O'Conner, it worked, baby!
Blow and go. I'm all clear.

Meet me at the point!
Hurry up, man! It's on, baby!

All right. 10-4, man.

Are you ready? Let's go!

Let me see your hands!
Let me see your hands!

AGENT: Freeze!

Clear!

(AGENTS CHATTERING)

MARKHAM: It's not Verone and Fuentes.

What do you mean,
not Verone and Fuentes?

Then where the hell are they?

Get off at Tarpon Point.

Tarpon Point?
There's no airstrip at Tarpon Point.

Who said anything about an airstrip?

Brian?

Brian, man, what's the hold-up, bro?

- Yo, bro. There's a new plan.
- What the hell?

We're meeting him at the Tarpon Point exit,
not the airstrip.

- So, what are you saying?
- Like I said, there's a new plan.

Brian?

Brian? Hello, you there?

Damn!

- Yo, what the hell is he doing?
- The feds are in the wrong place.

Brian's woman is on her own with Verone.

So...

So Brian's not coming!

- It's all right, let him out.
- Get out.

Pop the trunk.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

Hurry up.

Where's the rest of it?

- The other car.
- Another car?

- Where's the other car?
- On its way.

- On the way?
- Yeah.

Here's your money.

So you know nothing about the agents
that stormed my jet?

The funny thing is,
I only told one person about the airstrip.

Customs agents sure
are getting pretty, aren't they?

Put her on the boat.

- Let's go.
- Get on the boat.

Hide the cars and get rid of him.

ENRIQUE: Back in the car.

End of the road.

You know, I like you.

But I still got to kill you. It's my job.

(CLICKING)

What's that?

ROME: It's Barstow, baby!

It's about to get ugly!

(BOTH GRUNTING)

Let's go. Let's go.

(GRUNTING)

(SCREAMING)

(GROANING)

Come on.

You had me.

You slipped.

Eleven and a half months,
and you slipped once.

Put her downstairs.

See you in a second.

I thought you was dead, man.

Yeah, me, too.
Thanks for saving my ass, bro.

What are you doing, Brian?

I don't know, but if Verone sees
a helicopter or Customs boat, she's dead!

ROME: Boat.

Car. Boat.

You're not gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

- Yeah, I think so. You got my back, bro?
- Yeah.

All right, put on the seat belt.

Show him some Dukes of Hazzard shit!

We're gonna do this big!
Hold on, Rome! Hold on!

(ROME SCREAMING)

Brian, you're crazy, man!

What the hell are you doing?

(SCREAMING)

(SCREAMING)

(GROANING)

I think I broke my arm, man.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

(GUN COCKING)

Get the gun.

(GROANS)

It's over, Carter.

You okay?

Yeah!

I'm great.

We got him, man.

We got him. Let's get out of here.

That ought to do it.

So, there were three bags total?
The three from the boat?

So we're good, right?

Our records are clean?

You held up your end.

Your records are clean.

So maybe there were six bags.

I guess we can call it even.

- Agent Dunn?
- Sir.

We found some more evidence.

Come on, let's take it to the truck.

Don't drop the soap, big homey.

I hope you know that when he gets out,
he's going to kill your ass.

He ain't getting out.

I'll see you soon.

- You think he's going to get out?
- He'll be out.

Not for real.
You think he's getting out, dawg?

We took care of your decoys.
They're free and clear.

There's a sedan out on the road for you.

Try to bring it back in one piece.

Thanks a lot, Bilkins. You're all right.

- Thanks.
- Thanks for looking out, man.

Do you trust me now?

You're all right.

(GROANS)

Sorry.

Nice working with you, O'Conner.

Same here.

I might have to stay here in Miami,
and keep you out of trouble, bruh.

You know what I'm talking about.

You're going to kick it in Miami, bro?

Oh, man, I love Miami. Miami is off the hook!

Open a garage together.

A garage?
How are we going to do that, bruh?

Pockets ain't empty, cuz.

And we ain't hungry no more either, right?

(RAP THEME SONG PLAYING)


Señor O'Conner, señor O'Conner!

It's okay, you're just in time.

You're going to be a great father, Brian.

What makes you so sure?

Because I'll be there
to kick your ass if you ain't.

- Get in there.
- Go.

Brian.

Remember, the second
you go through those doors,

everything changes.

Our old life is done.

Let's go for a little ride.



- Special Agent Hobbs?
- Riley Hicks.

I read your file. Top of your class at FLETC.

Cairo, Tunis.

Youngest RSO ever in Afghanistan.

Hell, if you're half as good
as you are on paper,

we're going to get along just fine.

A Russian military caravan attacked,

satellite component stolen.

Cars just came out of nowhere.

Six hospitalized, a dozen vehicles destroyed.

All that in under 90 seconds, in and out.

This is world-class.

Job this good,
there's only one crew in the world

who could get this done.



How the hell did that get up there?

They caught one.

Where?

I got you five minutes with this guy.

I only need two.

I want your boss. Where's Shaw?

I ain't telling you shit.

I was hoping
you'd say that.

Is that legal?

No.

But are you going to go
in there and tell him?

I've got rights,
you asshole!

Not today.

No, no!

- Well, is he talking?
- Not anymore.

That room is
bugged, Hobbs.

So, any information
you just beat out of him, Interpol has now.

Great. Now they can take the morning off.
Shaw's in London.

Let's go pick him up.

Woman, you just
don't pick up Owen Shaw like he's groceries.

If you want to
catch wolves, you need wolves.

Let's go hunting.

This is what
100 million buys?

It wasn't that hard
to find you, Toretto.

I wasn't hiding.

How's the life
of the retired international criminal?

I like it here.
It's quiet.

Nice weather,

and no extradition.

So what are you
doing here, cop?

Last Tuesday,
a team of highly coordinated drivers

took down an entire
military convoy in Russia.

I don't do cold weather.

I know it wasn't you.

But you're going to help me
catch the team responsible.

--And you ain't gonna need that.

You can't touch him, Hobbs.
You've got no powers...

I'm not here to
extradite anyone.

See, he's going to
come voluntarily.

As a matter of fact,

he's going to beg me.

This was taken a week ago.

I'll see you out front.

It's Letty, isn't it?

It's impossible.

If that was my husband,
if there was a chance, no matter how small,

I would go.

I'm going to need everything,
all the info you got.

You'll get it when
the team gets it.

No team.

This is going to
have to be me alone.

It's not that simple.

The crew we're after, they hit like
thunder and disappear like smoke.

You go in alone,
you won't ever touch them.

I've been chasing this guy
across four continents and 12 countries,

and believe me,
the last damn place I want to be right now

is on your front doorstep,
selling Girl Scout cookies.

I need your help, Dom.

I need your team.

Okay, ladies,
bring it in.

Listen,
I want to make a toast.

Come on.

Listen, I know a few of y'all
have already been to Macau,

but you have
never seen the town

till you've seen it
through my eyes.

We got a penthouse suite

with an ocean view that's
going to change your life.

150-foot yacht with
a helicopter pad...

Mmm-hmm. Safe to say,
you're about to have the time of your lives.

No, you are.

- Cheers.

Nice!

I'm a citizen of the world.

Ever thought about
settling down?

Starting a life together?

Aren't we doing that?

Are we?

Hello?

Dom?

I'll be there.

Hey, my man,
I need you to turn this plane around.

All right, listen, ladies.
There's been a little change of plans.

Something came up.

You know that casino
I was telling you all about?

I got some vouchers

to the buffet.

What do you
think of this?

- He likes it.
- All right.

Yes.

Or this?

Yes.

That's my boy.
All right, let's see how this thing flies.

Are you watching?

It's Uncle Dom.
What do you know?

Are you waving?
What up?

Hey, Jack.

What's up, Uncle Dom?
What's up, Uncle Dom?

You excited to see him?

Are you already
pushing imports on him?

You say, "Dad's not
pushing anything."

He chose that car.

We know
he's an O'Conner, but,

I brought you
something, Jack.

- Yeah! He's also a Toretto.
- I don't know.

Luckily, he has
a couple more years to decide, right?

I think he decided, Mia.

I think it's time
for his nap.

Come on, baby. Okay.

Say bye.

It's weird, huh?

What's weird?

We got everything.

You know, down to the beer
and the barbeque.

But it just...

I don't know,
it just doesn't feel like home.

Maybe it's because, uh,

you don't realize how much
you appreciate something

until somebody takes it away.

I don't know.

The place has probably
changed so much,

you wouldn't even recognize it anymore.

Yeah.

Everything's changed.

So what's up with you?
What's going on?

Taken a week ago.

Diplomatic Security Service.

Hobbs.

You know,
I used to do this shit all the time as a cop.

This is exactly what cops do.
He's messing with your head.

Letty's dead, Dom.

I need to know for sure.

Then I'm going with you.

You said you were going to
leave this life behind.

We both said that we were
leaving the life behind.

He's right.

We're family.

If we got a problem,
we deal with it together.

And I'll feel safer
knowing you're both out there,

watching each other's backs.

You're stronger together.
You always were.

Now go get Letty.

Bring her home.

Thank God!

Finally, some equipment
I can work with.

What up, boy?

This is way better
than that trash in Rio.

Way better.

You sure about these guys?

Nope.

Has anybody heard
from Leo or Santos?

Last time anyone saw them, they were hitting
up the casinos in Monte Carlo.

I thought that was
our last job, Brian.

And who's paying for all this equipment?
The taxpayers?

So now we work for The Hulk?
That's what we're doing?

Why do I smell baby oil?

If you keep
running your piehole,

you're going to
smell an ass-kicking.

All right, Hobbs,

you got the best
crew in the world

standing right
in front of you.

Give them a reason to stay.

Our target is Owen Shaw.

Former major in the S.A.S.,
Spec-ops soldier.

He ran the UK's Mobility Division
in Kabul and Basra.

Ah, damn.
That Mobility unit's the truth.

We're talking vehicular warfare.
Best in the world.

- You got some chips?
- Those guys don't mess around.

For years, they've been
running jobs in Europe,

but it's their
most recent jobs

that graduated them
to a whole new level.

Three targets,
highly specific.

The program terminal
from an ICBM missile...

Got a little change?

Seriously?
You're a millionaire,

and you're still
trying to ask for money?

That's how you
stay a millionaire.

So what does
this all mean?

Well, our best guess is
that Shaw's crew

is building
a Nightshade device.

- Which is?
- A tech bomb.

Designed to block
an entire military communication grid

for 24 hours.

If you blind a soldier
for a single second

in the middle of a fight,
he dies.

If you blind
a country for 24 hours,

the loss of life
is unthinkable.

This could be worth billions
to the right buyer.

Billions?

Why don't we just
steal that shit?

Hey, man.

Which one of these
things is a dollar?

It says something about...

It's on the house.

I want you to
help me catch Shaw.

He's only got
one piece left that he needs,

and I intend to stop him
before he gets it.

Now, I know
you guys are a family.

So I'm offering you
a chance right now

to make that
family whole again.

You want to make
this family whole again?

Get us to Letty,
we'll get you Shaw,

full pardons
all the way around.

I can't promise you that.

Yes, you can.

That's the deal.

Take it or leave it.

You get me Shaw,

and I'll get your pardons.

You heard him.

But this is different.

We're not
dealing with cops,

we're not dealing
with drug dealers.

This is a whole
different level.

We're getting paid,
right?

Interpol picked up
one of Shaw's guys in Moscow.

I went in, had a little
therapy session with him.

He gave up Shaw's hideout.

Then why aren't we
down there now?

Well, we weren't invited.

Hobbs, they're sending in
your punching bag.

He's wired. He's going to give a positive ID
on Shaw before they move in.

So, the cops just let you go, huh?

Don't worry,
I didn't give them shit.

Oh, I'm not worried.

Okay,

turn it over for me.

God, it's amazing.

The simplest things
can cause the biggest problems.

Good news is,
if you swap out a bad part,

everything runs
smooth as silk again.

Look, Shaw...

Wait, Shaw! Shaw!

Shaw!

I just got confirmation on Shaw.
They're going in.

Wait, wait, hold up...

Police scanners are saying
alarms are going off at Interpol headquarters.

Shit.

He brought us here
so he could take down Interpol.

This whole thing's a set-up.

- Brian, take the team.
- What about you?

Hobbs and I will
wait for Shaw.

Shaw leads to Letty.

Come on, you son of a bitch.

What's this?

It's your share
from the last job.

You're part
of the team, Oakes.

You do your job,
you get paid.

There's a little
extra in there for you.

Consider it an advance.

For what?

The next job, of course.

Which job?

The one we're
working right now.

Han, how far
are we from Interpol?

Twelve blocks away.

You guys,
it's a ghost town over here.

Shaw must have pulled
all the cops to him.

All right, y'all,
we're in this shit, so let's go get it.

It's been fun
running with you, mate.

Stop! Drop the bag!

- There he is.
- On it.

Toretto, it's on you.
Straight ahead, don't lose him.

Ain't gonna happen.

Sorry about that, boys.

Interpol, straight ahead.

Let's go, guys.
We've got company.

Let's go, boys.

Get in! Let's go!

Hey! We got to move. Now!

- Shaw, we have three cars tailing us.
- You know what to do.

Guys, I got the Rover.

Okay, I got...

Whatever the hell
that thing is.

What is that, a hockey puck?

Oh, shit!

Approaching
rendezvous point.

Dom! Tej and Roman are out! Where you at?

I'm right behind you!

Stay on track.
I'm taking the contingency.

Boys, I got eyes on Shaw.
He just made a left.

- I got right.
- Toretto, make that left!

No problem.

Letty.

Take the wheel.

Letty.

This is crazy.

We are not in Brazil.

So, now we got cars
flying in the air?

On some 007-type shit?
This is not what we do!

Man, you really got
to check that emotion.

Your voice just
went from Shaggy to Scooby-Doo.

"This is not what we..."

See, man, when a woman
starts shooting at you,

that's a clear sign
to back the fuck off!

We need to get
the hell out of Dodge!

That could have been
my forehead, man.

No.

That's not as big
as your forehead.

Mia...

Uh, It's definitely Letty.

But it's, uh.. It's complicated.

Letty's alive.

That's all that matters.

We have her back, Brian.

Well, do me a favor
and give Jack a kiss goodnight for me.

- Be safe.
- I love you, Mia.

She definitely saw
it was you?

She looked dead at me, Brian.

Maybe the Letty
we once knew is gone, Dom.

Even though she's alive,
maybe she's gone.

You don't turn
your back on family.

Even when they do.

- Ivory.
- Yo.

It's going to
need some repairs.

No problem, treacle.

Are you good?

Yeah.

Okay, listen up.

That was a very
different breed

from Hobbs' usual
wannabe warriors.

We need to learn
who these people are, what they're made of.

Vegh?

O'Conner, Parker,

Pearce, Toretto

and the rest of the team.

These guys are
common criminals.

Tonight these
common criminals were seconds away

from taking us down.

Show them
the respect they deserve, or it weakens us.

You might
want to see this.

Ring any bells?

Yeah.

That's the guy I shot.

You look happy.

I don't remember him.

That's bullshit.

We got a problem, guys.

We got a picture of her
with the guy who almost took you out.

Klaus, aren't you
team muscle?

Don't make me go over there
and make you team pussy.

She doesn't
remember him.

Names and records
aren't enough.

I want personal information.
Get into their lives, into their minds.

Find their weaknesses,
and we will exploit them.

Mmm-hmm. Yeah, right.

This is crazy, man.

What are you
talking about now?

I'm sitting here
looking at these images...

It's like we're hunting
our evil twins.

Look at this
black dude right here, he's handsome.

Clearly, that's me.

We got a white Hobbs.
This is Han.

Tej, it's an African
in a beanie.

That's like
your Mini-Me, man.

And Brian!

When did you do
this photo shoot?

I'm just playing, man.

You know you're
the prettiest blonde around here.

All right, lock it up.
We got two things.

First off, this is the worst damn city in the
world to commit a crime.

They got cameras on
every street corner.

I got video footage
from CCTV of the raid.

Let's track that,
see where it leads us.

And secondly,
we just got confirmation

on what Shaw's crew
grabbed from Interpol.

They ripped off
the database

of every location that houses the
final component that they need.

So where are they at?

There are over
two dozen of them around Europe.

But the list is
only good for 96 hours.

Which means,
wherever Shaw's crew is going to hit next,

it's going to happen
within the next four days.

They got a window,
and so do we.

- We gotta move.
- Hobbs is right.

So let's break this down.

You met them.
What do we know?

We know they
have to be running custom engines.

You heard that flip car
going through those gears.

Sequential transmission.

That didn't sound
like a normal engine.

That was a turbo diesel.

It sounded like something
you hear at Le Mans.

Did you see it
take all those hits

and still stay flat
in the corners?

Yeah, hydraulics.

Or magnetic suspension.

Who not only has
access to the components,

but can fabricate
something like that?

Maybe a handful
of shops in London.

Regular tuner shops
aren't going to cut it on this one.

We're going to have to
dig deeper than that.

Han, Gisele, Roman,
you're up.

We find the guy
who made that car,

we find Shaw.

--Let's go.

- I'll help.
- Roger that.

Tej, we're gonna need cars without computer
chips that can be overridden.

Make sure they're fast.

I got this.

I'm already on it, Dom.
I've contacted R&D at DSS.

Hobbs...

I said I got this.

This should be interesting.

Man, you really
got to loosen up.

You can't just throw a bunch of factory-line
Beemers at people and expect...

Hey. That car is a hell of a car.

You're talking about twin-turbo V8,

spitting out 560 ponies, son.

He reads the brochure. I'm proud.

But with cars,
you have to customize.

It's all between you
and the car you build.

It's a bond,
it's a commitment.

It sounds like a marriage.

Yeah, but with cars,
when you trade up,

they don't take
half your shit.

Jesus.

With price tags like this,
these cars better be made out of gold.

You ain't thinking about
stealing these cars, are you, Parker?

Kitchen help entrance
is towards the back.

Come again?

I don't mean any offense,
gentlemen,

but you couldn't
possibly afford the cars in this auction.

Substantial lack
of gaudy jewelry, no entourage, no honeys.

Clearly you're
not a "baller."

And you.

Hmm. Shoes, shirt, trousers.

Functional.

And your posture,
too rigid, no swagger.

My guess is military.
Take home of 50,000 a year.

That's U.S.

Which is not enough
to be playing here.

So, if you're not
kitchen help,

then you must be
in the wrong place.

But please,
do finish your champagne.

Oh, he needs to be
taught a lesson.

Like I said,
you ain't stealing these cars.

I got this.

All right, this is
number five on our list.

Holy shit.

What's the dude plan on hunting? Moby Dick?

That must be our guy.

So, how do you all
want to play this?

Han and I got this.

We go in tight,
you let me do all the talking,

and you all
have my back on it.

There's one thing
you boys are forgetting.

He's a man.

Let's go.

"He's a man"?

You know,
she always says that.

What you're looking at
is a 5.45 by 18 FMJ spitzer bullet.

It's specific to one handgun, the PSM.

Given that handguns are
illegal in the United Kingdom,

there's very few people
that have access to that firearm.

So if somebody wanted to, say,

track down where it came from,

it wouldn't be too hard.

I was a cop for a lot of years.
Some habits die hard.

A pawn shop.

I don't know, man.
That was disrespectful.

And I don't like
the way she said it,

like, "He's a man."

"He's a man"?
So, what are we?

Come on,
she's just doing her job.

"Doing her job."

I see what's going on.

See what?

You got the little
stardust in your eyes, eh?

Little birds floating
around a little bit.

Uh, you don't want to lease this model.
You want to buy.

Can you please stop talking?

No, no, you're in love! Look at you!

Just stop.

You got special plans?
Big day?

You're going to
invite us all out?

Better make sure you
get her a big rock, man,

'cause she doesn't
look like she'll be that easily impressed.

And if it's not
a big rock,

you better be big
somewhere else.

You know what I'm talking about.

That's why all your girlfriends wear
so much bling, huh?

We're looking for information.

You're looking for information? About what?

Information about cars.

In particular,
two you designed recently.

Ramp cars.
Low slung, skeletal frames.

We'd be very interested
to find the man who bought those.

Why should I help you?

Because we're
asking you nicely.

Because you're
asking me nicely?

What can you offer
that I can't get from a thousand other girls?

Hmm?

Stop! Stop!

You look like a man
who likes it rough.

My friend here can
give you heights of pain

you've never
experienced before.

Do we have a deal?

Deal! Deal! Deal!

I take it back.

Me likey.

Stop, stop, stop.

So this is how you "got this"?
By buying all of his cars?

What good is having
millions of dollars in the bank

if you don't spend
any of it?

But don't worry about that.
Watch this.

Mr. Parker, again,
can I just express our gratitude

and say how much
we appreciate your business.

If there's ever
anything else you need, you just have to ask.

- Anything?
- Mmm-hmm.

Now that you mention it,
my swagger-less friend here,

he really likes
that shirt you have on.

Uh, this shirt?

That shirt.

I'm not entirely sure that this shirt
would fit your friend.

It will fit.

He needs a shirt
that's a little less...

Functional.

That's it, functional.

Okay.

- I'll hold that.
- Thank you.

Come on, man,
time is money.

Yes, doing my best.

Damn, you need
some hedge clippers for that shit.

Well, if that will be all...

And the pants, too.

Right.

While you're at it,
let me get that watch.

I like that watch.

This is for you.

- And this is for you.
- Thank you.

Good day, gentlemen.
Thank you.

So I, um,

I got the information in here.

May I ask why
you're looking for Shaw?

He took something of ours.

We'd like to talk
to him about it.

Let's see
what we've got.

All right.
What do you want?

They say
if someone's looking for a Russian gun,

you're the man to see.

Oh, they do, do they?

What do you want, mate?

That might be a bad idea.

- I'm looking for the owner of this.
- I don't know.

Take a closer look.

About a week ago,
a girl came in,

bought guns, ammo,
everything I had.

A girl?

What did she look like?

Tough chick, dark hair.

Mean streak.

Word is
she's a street racer.

Where can we find her?

How do I know?
Do I look like a racer?

No. You don't.

Take care, guys.

Oh, shit.

Sorry, girls.

Let's go!

Hold on.

Stay with me. Stay with me.

Tell me where
to find Shaw,

and I'll make him
pay for this.

Braga...

Ow!

Hey, you!

Stop right there!

- You go!
- No, you go!

No one needs to
know about this.

No one.

We lost Ivory.

He's gone.

Thanks.

That's it?

If Ivory's dead,
he made a mistake.

If you make a mistake,
you pay the price.

That's a great eulogy, Shaw.

Are you going to
give the same speech

for the rest of us
when we go out?

You're the last one
I'd have pegged to be sentimental.

I like you, Letty.

I dare say I even
feel a certain warmth towards you.

When I found you
in the hospital,

and you couldn't
remember anything,

I said to myself,

"This girl has a gift.

"She's a blank page."

And that made me feel
somewhat protective toward you.

If something happened to you, for instance,

I think I might find that
slightly harder to bear.

What I'm saying is,

I would hate to see you

make a mistake.

I'm going to get some air.

- What the hell happened?
- We met Dom's girlfriend.

She's lovely.

- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

Tej, what have you got? Footage, CCTV?
Talk to me.

I just went
through all of it.

Believe it or not, everywhere Shaw's team is,
the cameras are down.

That's a hell
of a coincidence.

All right, we're going to pay CCTV a little visit.
Let's roll.

What is that?

That is a new toy for you.

So, what happened?

Shaw's goons showed up
and started shooting up the place.

But we got something big.

- What?
- Braga.

He's working with Shaw.

What are you talking about?

It's true. That phone's filled
with coded payment transactions

that lead straight
to Braga's cartel.

Who the hell is Braga?

He ran one of the biggest cartels in Mexico.

And my old boss.

We used codes
just like that

to move money
out of the country.

It all makes sense.

Braga was running Letty,
now he's working with Shaw.

It would explain how
the two of them met.

Okay, so you all know
all this information

about him,
where do we find him?

He's sitting in a prison in Los Angeles.

How do you know that?

Brian put him there.

All right,
so this is the break we were looking for.

If the two of them were working together,

Braga will know what Shaw's up to.

I'm going to pay him a visit.

Are you serious right now?

Think about what you're saying.

You're wanted, Brian.

The moment you step
foot off that plane, it's a wrap.

You're not coming back.

"Coming back"?
How are you going to get in the country?

Let me worry about that.

This is on me.

I'm the one that served her up to Braga.

I'm the one that gets to make it right.

Let me make it right.

Be careful.

He's ready to see you now.
Right this way.

Thank you for seeing us.
I won't take up much of your time.

My men were attacked earlier today.

I'm going to need to see all cameras

in and around Waterloo station.

Will somebody
tell Captain America here

- that requires clearance?

Terry,

bring up cameras 58 through 62, earlier today.

They've been down for maintenance
all morning.

Sorry.

Okay. Well, we appreciate your help.
Thank you.

You know what I find very interesting

is Interpol was attacked recently as well.

Those cameras were down, too.
Didn't catch a thing.

Nothing.

Now, that means either

your maintenance schedule lines up

perfectly with their escape route

or it's someone here
that's working with them.

And that's just ridiculous.

Because there ain't no way in hell

anybody here would be working for them.

Particularly you,
ain't that right?

No, no, that's ridiculous.

That is ridiculous.

I'm going to need direct access
to your live feed

citywide.

And I also strongly suggest
that you put a hold on any more

"maintenance."

Yeah, of course.

We appreciate your help.
Thank you so much.

Well, well, well.

The orange in that
really makes your eyes pop.

Thanks, fellas.

Tell me something,
O'Conner,

how is it you keep
running around the world,

breaking every law
known to man,

and yet here I am,
putting my job on the line for you?

You'll feel a lot better
once you get the credit for taking down Shaw.

Oh, I'm tempted
to settle for you.

Well, you know what
they say, Stasiak,

if you want the
career-changing big fish,

you got to be willing
to put on the big boy panties

and sail out
to the deep water.

You're an asshole,
you know that?

I missed you, too, man.
I really missed you.

I got you admitted into Victorville
to do whatever you got to do.

It's a 24-hour hold.

You need to be out
of there by 9:00 a.m.

That's when Forensics will run your
fingerprints through the national database.

That program will match you

and when they find out
who you really are,

I won't be able to
get you back out.

We're talking life in prison.

Cute kid.

So, I found out Braga's being held
in cell block D3.

That's solitary.

I only had enough juice
to get you in Gen Pop.

So you're going to have to
do something to get his attention.

Sorry about this, man.

Sorry about what?

Again?

Big Brother's
about to go live.

Damn, you can't flick a booger in London
without somebody noticing.

Hey! Don't touch that.
That's nothing to play with, man.

What's the problem?

That's high-tensile
titanium cable.

What does that mean?

That's what they use
to anchor buildings and hold up bridges,

stuff you know
nothing about!

See, now, their version,
it works cool,

but mine, masterpiece.

See, I reversed the gears,
torqued the motor

and added this tank
to the back.

That makes it even sweeter.

It does.

It's not dummy-proof.

Man, I've been known to handle big guns.
Relax.

You've been
known to handle that big-ass head.

Dom, I did some checking,
asked around,

got the location of
a street race tonight.

Brian O'Conner.

That was quite an entrance.

You put a lot of
these men in here.

What?
You didn't think one would recognize you?

I've kept tabs on you, you know.

You've been having a lot of fun out there.

Good cop gone bad,
Rio de Janeiro.

It's exciting when you go criminal, isn't it?

Too bad you didn't do it earlier,
you could have worked for me.

Like Letty Ortiz?

So tell me something,
because I buried her.

Yeah? You did?

You buried something,
I couldn't tell you who or what it was.

I know she's running with Owen Shaw.

Still playing cop, huh?

Trust me, this is way above your pay grade.

Humor me, please.

Well, you're a dead man walking,
what does it matter?

I ran everything for Shaw.

Drugs, guns, money, women.

He taught me to think global
when I was just local.

He made me a wealthy man.

And this guy didn't just have
the cartels working for him.

He had the CIA, DEA,
everyone in his pocket.

He knew what was
going to happen before they did.

In fact, he even knew when
some wet-behind-the-ears FBI agent

decided to put some informant in my cartel.

The minute you put Letty undercover,
she was dead, bro.

But she survived.

That girl is one tough bitch.

Shaw found her
in a hospital two days later.

He went to finish the job.

And he didn't kill her. Why?

She had no memory.

Perfect girl, huh?

You're lucky this door's between us.

What happened to Letty
is on your head.

Look at me! Look at me.

You won't do it.

What is Shaw up to?

How do you think he knows your next move
before you make it?

He's got eyes on you.

Think about it.

The only way you get close to Shaw

is if he wants you there.

You've got some
serious balls, man.

I've been told.

You know, you're lucky I missed my shot.

I think you hit your mark.

Really?

What is it with you?

Do you got a death wish or something?

If that's what it takes.

I just want to race.

You might lose your car.

Let's do it.

Your funeral.

Ride or die, remember?

Listen up!

Out here, we're used
to getting what we want.

This is London, baby.

But remember,

don't bite the bait.

Are you ready?

- Ready?
- Ready.

Steady.

Go!

Just like old times.

This guy is crazy.

You got to be kidding me.

You're still upshifting early.

I do that so you brake.

You lose traction
and the back end kicks out.

I noticed.

Look, just because you know how I ride,
doesn't mean you know me.

You know what they say
where we're from?

Show me how you drive,
I'll show you who you are.

V8.

You never could resist
American muscle.

Nice scar.

You never could
keep yourself out of trouble, either.

What else do you know about me?

About you?

Everything.

Like this scar.

You got that the first night we met.
You were 15.

First street race.

Some kid trying to show off
lost control of his car,

wiped out right next to you.

You're lucky you didn't lose your arm.

And let me guess,

you saved me.

No.

I was the kid showing off.

And here...

Boyle Heights.

You were fleeing with my little sister Mia
and got trapped in a corner.

And you thought
it was a good idea

to ride your Torino Cobra
through a retaining wall.

All right, how about this one?

That's the last time we were together.

In the DR.

You wanted to go for a night swim.

You cut yourself on the reef.

I followed you.

I even got this scar to match.

Look, I don't know why you're here,

but I really think you're over your head.

I'm here for you.

That girl you remember,

it's not me.

Not from what I just saw.

Like it or not,

you're still the same girl.

I saw it out there.

I see it right now.

I got to go.

Hey.

It belongs to you.

There she goes,

leaving you again.

Bloody fickle, that one.

You want bloody?
We could do bloody.

A street kid,

starts out stealing DVD players in East L.A.,

ends up heisting $100 million in Rio.

Not bad, huh?

It's a good story, isn't it?

Almost inspiring.

See, what I couldn't fathom is

why he's not relaxing on a beach somewhere

with that cute little Brazilian number.

Instead, he's working with
a two-bit government hack like Hobbs.

And then I realized,

he has a weak spot.

We all got a weak spot.

You know,

when I was young,
my brother always used to say,

"Every man has to have a code."

Mine?

Precision.

A team is nothing but pieces you switch
out until you get the job done.

It's efficient.

It works.

But you?

You're loyal to a fault.

Your code is about family.

And that's great in the holidays,
but it makes you predictable.

And in our line of work,
predictable means vulnerable.

And that means I can reach out
and break you whenever I want.

At least when I go,
I'll know what it's for.

Well,

at least you have a code.

Most men don't.

So,

I'm going to give you a chance.

Take your crew and walk away.

That's the only way
you're going to keep your family safe.

Your brother never told you never
to threaten a man's family?

It's a pretty stupid thing to do.

But I'll make it simple for you.

I walk away when she walks away.

Well, then,

it appears this inspiring tale
has come to an end.

If that's the way it has to go.

Let me guess...

Hobbs.

Come on, you son of a bitch.

The "two-bit government hack."

See you around, Toretto.

You can bet on it.

Riley, Shaw's leaving Battersea,
heading southeast.

Have Tej track him on his live feed. Go.

You know what
would have happened

if I didn't put that tracker in your car?

This one?

You know, this just got me
one step closer to Shaw.

For what it's worth, Toretto,

I hope it gets you closer
to what you want, too.

This better have been worth it.

More than you'll ever know.

Pretty.

May I?

I'm going to ask you a question, Letty,

and I want you to think very hard
before you answer.

When I give you the order

to take Toretto out,

what will your first thought be?

Why don't you look me in the eye

and you tell me what you see.

Keep it.

Tej, talk to me, what have we got?

We were able to track Shaw
after he left you and Dom,

but this guy's smart,
so we could only track him so far.

He seems to know all the city's blind spots.

See, we lost him somewhere in here,

which means he could be anywhere

within that half-a-mile radius.

Maybe if we cross-reference
phone records, leases...

No, this has got Shaw's name
written all over it.

We've got vantage points,
multiple exits,

subways, highways
and storm drains.

Bad-ass and brains.

Woman, you keep that up,
I'm going to be out of a job.

All right, let's go nail that son of a bitch.

They're long gone.

There's nothing here.

There's never nothing.

There's always something.

Let's go, guys.

Shaw, everyone is in place.
All things moving according to plan.

Good. Send him in.

Yo, it's Hobbs.

What have you got, Parker?
Give me something good.

Yeah, that paint you got from Shaw's place
is highly specialized.

Anti-thermal low-IR coating.

- Military.
- Exactly.

We got a list of bases around Europe
that use this paint type

and those specific colors.

All right,
let's cross-reference that

with all of Shaw's
military targets.

I guaran-damn-tee you
one of them is gonna match.

Bingo.
It's a NATO base in Spain.

That puts Shaw in a different country.

That means he's got an eight-hour lead on us.

We gotta move now.
Tej, give me that info.

Riley and I will go ahead
and we're going to lock down the base.

We're going to protect
that component personally.

Toretto, I'll arrange transportation for you
and your cars.

You brush up on your Spanish, boys.
I'll see you en España.

You son of a bitch! You made it!

- What up, man?
- Good to see you.

Good to see you.
So, what's going on here?

Figured out they're hitting an army base
in Spain.

Border patrol ID'ed Shaw's men
crossing through last night.

Hobbs and Riley went
to lock down the base.

- They're going to meet us there.
- Where's Dom?

He wasn't going without you.

I found out what happened to Letty.

It's all my fault.

Brian,

whatever you found out,
that's for you.

What we're about to do now

is for her.

We've got four teams on overwatch,

sniper-spotters in roosts
north and south of the target.

Just keep all your men out of sight.

When they drive that truck in here,

I want to come crashing down on them
like the walls of Jericho.

Hobbs, I just caught this one disabling
the perimeter security system.

- Your house is compromised.
- What are you suggesting?

I ain't suggesting.

We follow protocol,
we move the component out.

Shaw thinks it's here. We're going to get it
out of here before he arrives.

Stealth and speed are going to
be our two best friends.

We're going to protect our little egg,
move it out of the henhouse,

then we're going to wait
for that goddamn fox to arrive.

I just got word
they caught one of Shaw's men at the base.

It's time.

Something is not right.
He wanted us to find that guy.

Think about it.
At Interpol, you were face-to-face with him.

Brian,
so what are you saying?

Braga said the only way you get near Shaw
is if he wants you to.

Tej, where's that component?

They're moving it
to a secure location.

Shaw ain't hitting that base.

He's hitting the convoy.

Let's go!

We've got a report,
the convoy's under attack.

Get a chopper, now!

Fellas, you better hurry up.
They just took the convoy.

And Dom,

Letty's with them.

We stick to the plan.

All right,
you heard the man.

Let's play this fast and clean.

That thing's heading your way.

All systems go.

Everything looks stable.

Uh, guys,
we gotta come up with another plan.

They got a tank.

I'm sorry, did somebody just say "a tank"?

We got company, guys.

Toretto is coming right at you.

Okay. Get the weapons hot.

Give me satellite imaging.

Straight ahead of us.

There you are.

Who's got a plan B?

Plan B?
We need a plan C, D, E.

We need more alphabets!

Hey, we do
what we do best.

We improvise, all right?

Okay, Jah.
Take it to the other side.

Let's have some fun.

What the hell is wrong with you?
This isn't part of the plan.

Take their attention
away from the people!

Shaw, you don't have to do this.

We got one right
in front of us.

Boom.

Oh, shit!

You lucky bastard.

Roman, you hang in there.

Hang in there, man!

Somebody better do something!
I got a tank on my ass!

There's gotta be
a break up ahead.

Oh, look,

a bridge.

Screw it.

- Yeah!

We're dragging a car behind us.

Brian, that Mustang would
make a nice anchor.

Yeah, I'm on it.

Damn!

Shaw, we've got to
get rid of that car.

Letty, go take care
of the cable.

Yeah!

What's she doing?

Shit!

Okay, Toretto.

Here's your girl...

And your happy ending.

Letty!

Jesus Christ.

I can't believe they
stole a 70-ton tank

for a three-ounce
computer chip.

That 3-ounce computer chip
is more deadly than 1,000 of those tanks.

What about her?

Not her.

She was working with Shaw.

Was,

but she's always
been one of us.

Let's give them a minute.

Let's go process Shaw and his crew.

I've never looked more forward to
filling out paperwork in my life.

Hey.

Look, I don't even know
how to say this to you,

but everything that's happened here
is because of me.

I'm the one that put you undercover...

Stop.

I may not remember anything,

but I know one thing about myself.

Nobody makes me do anything
I don't want to.

So, what's our next adventure after this?

How about we stay in one place?

Where are you thinking?

Tokyo.

We always talk about Tokyo.

Tokyo it is.

Can I ask you something?

How did you know that there would
be a car there to break our fall?

I didn't.

Some things you just
have to take on faith.

Hey, Toretto!

You need to hear this.

You guys really
think you've won.

This code you live by,

it's the very reason
why you weren't even in the game.

I told you exactly what I was gonna do
if you didn't walk away, Toretto.

Go!

But you didn't listen.

I told you I can reach out
and break you whenever I want.

And I have.

Come on.

- Go.
- No!

Maybe you should call Mia.

- Mia?
- Brian!

Let me go!

So, this is how it's gonna go down.

You're gonna cut me loose from these cuffs,

you're gonna hand me the chip,

I'm gonna walk out of here
and you're not gonna follow.

You must be joking.

Look at his face.

Ask him if I'm joking.

One hostage does not outweigh
the threat to millions.

I'm sorry,
but this changes nothing.

It changes everything.

You tell your men to stand down.

Stand down.

Toretto,

I need you to know,

the moment we let him
walk out that door with that chip,

words like "amnesty" and "pardon"

walk out with him.

Those words went out
the day we were born.

Coming, babe?

Of course.

I wouldn't miss it for the world.

Like I said,

you were never in the game.

If I see you on the horizon,
I'll make the call and the girl's dead.

So, what about Toretto's sister?

There's no need for her anymore.

I just jammed every signal
up and down the spectrum.

Let's move.

I'm coming with you.

Where the hell does this dude
think he's going?

We're on an army base,
he's trapped.

Wow, you just had
to open your mouth.

Now we got a big-ass plane to deal with.

That ain't a plane. That's a planet.

She's as good as dead
if Shaw gets away on that plane.

Then we don't let him get away.

Let's end this thing.

Ride or die.

Ride or die.

Tell them to take off!

Babe, get me under the wing.

If I can hit that flap,
we can keep it from taking off.

You be careful.

This is who we are.

Shit!

Grab the wheel!

Dom!

Go!

Come on. Let's go.

Get in the car.

Whoo!

What happened?
Did you hit the flap?

Uh...

You should buckle up right now.

What?

Hey!

Wrong team, bitch.

Shit.

Yeah!

I got you.

Tej!

Keep her steady!

- We gotta move, it's going down!
- Go!

Go, now!

Come on, let's move, move, move!

Come on!

Dom!

Where's Gisele?

Where's Gisele?

So this is worth billions, huh?

Yes, it is.

Name your price, Dom.

1327.

Don't burn it this time. Please?

I never go and burn it, man.

Good food.

The air quality here is lousy, the traffic is bad,

but I think you'll learn to like this place.

Yeah, and here you've
got your own garage

so you can build a car with Daddy.

We'll be building a car?

First car better be a Charger, Jack.

You mean Skyline.

Like I said, he's a Toretto.

You're confusing the kid.

Mia, you're gonna let him
get away with this?

You're really going to do it?

Tokyo.

Yeah, it's just something I gotta do.

You know we got your back,
whenever you need us.

Hey, Mia, you better hide your baby oil.

I'm just playing.

- You better hide that big-ass forehead.

I was just joking, but whatever.

Definitely not that funny.

It's official.

You're all free.

- Mmm.
- Mmm.

It wasn't half bad,
having you work for me.

We all know you were working for me, Hobbs.

Agree to disagree.

Thank you.

Good luck.

Elena?

Letty.

This is gonna be awkward.

- But sexy as hell.
- Sexy as hell.

I wanted to thank you
for everything you've done for him.

For us.

It takes an amazing woman.

He's an amazing guy.

Yeah, he is.

Try to keep him out of trouble, huh?

Now, you know that's not gonna happen.

I know.

Not bad for a cop.

I never thought I'd trust a criminal.

Until next time.

Until next time.

Elena.

You know you don't have to go.

All this... This is your family.

It's who you are.

This is my family.

This is who I am.

All right, everybody, let's eat.

Want some help with that?

It's all here, it's done.

Come on, man, let's get with it.

First bite, he's got grace.

House rules, man. House rules.

Any of this feel familiar to you?

No.

But it feels like home.

That's good enough for me.

All right, y'all.
Come on, let's do this.

- Okay, Roman,

bless our table.

Father, thank you for
the gathering of friends.

Father, we give thanks
for all the choices we've made,

because that's what
makes us who we are.

Let us forever cherish the loved ones
we've lost along the way.

Thank you for the little angel,

the newest addition to our family.

Thank you for bringing Letty home.

And most of all, thank you for fast cars.

Dominic Toretto.

You don't know me,


All right, we're good to go.

-You got this?
-You bet your ass, bubba.

Let's make some money!

Everyone in position.

Letty wouldn't let them junk it.

l want to see the crash site.

with Deputy Director Lawson.

lf we don't make serious inroads into
the Braga case in the next 72 hours,

they're gonna shut us down.

l know l'm a newbie here,
but why the clock now?

Because it's been two years,

and the last three agents we sent to infiltrate
his organization came back in body bags.

He's moved more heroin across the border
than Escobar did in 1 0 years.

This guy is becoming
one of our biggest national threats,

and we don't even have a picture of him.

We don't have prints!
Not even a goddamn DOB!

What's the status on David Park?

lsn't he our ticket into
the Braga organization?

We're running the name through city and
county databases, sorting the possibilities.

We've got over 500 already.

Park's insignificant.
Sounds like another jerk-off to me.

BRlAN: lt's not. Without Park, Braga wouldn't
have drivers to move his shipments.

their abuelita to be behind the wheel.

Someone that drives their 1 0-second cars
not in a straight line,

but to push it and make it through places
no one else would take it.

Real drivers.

Having the Feds raid your house

So unfortunate.

l wish l could say
l was surprised to see you here.

What's to stop someone

Probably the same thing that's keeping me

(SlGHlNG) You better have

You disobeyed a direct order.

-Where's the shipment?

Look, we could use the shipment
to parade in front of the media,

get a few hundred pounds of heroin
off the street,

but Braga's just gonna send another
shipment next week and the week after that.

Let's use the shipment to lure Braga out

and lop the head off
a multi-billion dollar cartel.

-And how do you suggest we do that?
-A hand-to-hand exchange with Braga.

-He'll never show.
-He can't afford not to.

You got a plan?

There's a price.

We bag Braga, you let Toretto walk.

(RlNGlNG)

You know, when l gave you my number,
l was hoping you'd call.

But not under these circumstances.

What circumstances? Me being alive?

Don't take it personally.

-lt's just business.
-l got some business of my own.

Get Campos.

lt's them.

Was that how Braga inspires loyalty?
Killing his drivers?

One can always find more drivers.

lt's just good business.

l want to trade.

-Braga doesn't negotiate.
-(SCOFFS) Fine.

You explain to him how all of a sudden
$60 million worth of product disappears.

l know that can't be good for business.

What do you want?

Six million cash, delivered by Braga himself.

l don't like being shot at.

He'll never go for it.

Either l deal with Braga, or you do.

Sir, players are onsite.
Holding positions at the perimeter.

All right. Listen up. Everybody stay frosty.

We don't move a muscle until
O'Conner gives the signaI.

Well, the good news is,
when we get this guy,

you walk out of here a free man.

As of now,

What about Braga?

That's no longer your concern.

We now know where Braga is, right?

Mexico is out of our jurisdiction.

You don't know me.

You're about to.

Private number Tokyo, Japan.

Get down!

Jack!

Jack!

Shattered his collarbone,
fractured his leg in two places.

He only regained
consciousness this morning.

First thing he said was, "Get me Dom".

He's in there.

You okay?

I'm fine.

He's waiting. Let's go.

Got something for you.

Your files.

Thank you.

You risk life and limb to
save the free world...

and what do they give you?

Jell-O and a bad 70's TV show.

Y'know, it's got its perks.

Sponge baths ain't that bad.

Dad!

I'm sorry, baby.

"Dad"?

Honey, I want to introduce you to somebody.

He's a, uhh...

He's an old friend.

Go on and say hello.

Dominic Toretto, right?

My dad said, he kicked your ass once.

Who did this?

You remember Owen Shaw?

The one we tore half of
London down trying to get.

Well...

This is his big, bad brother.

Take a look at this.

"Deckard Shaw"

British Special Forces assassin.

The kind of unique asset...

that no government would
ever admit to employing.

Black Ops boys.

Worse. They created a monster.

They felt Shaw was a necessary
evil until eventually...

they decided he was unnecessary.

The powers that be, felt that he
knew just a little bit too much.

The asset became a liability.

So they sent in 20 elite
operatives to retire him.

And they missed.

That was 6 years ago and Shaw's
been a ghost ever since.

Until now.

How do I find him?

The official answer is: you don't.

He killed Han.

Almost killed my family.

He also tried to put me in a body bag, too.

Which is why when I get out, I'm
gonna put a hurt on him so bad...

he's gonna wish his mother
had kept her legs closed.

But until then, my
official answer to you...

is stand down.

Now you know I can't do that.

I do know you, Dom.

Which is why now I give you a
brother to brother answer.

You do whatever it is you gotta do.

When you find that son of a bitch...

Just do me one favor.

What's that?

Don't miss.

MONTECRISTO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

Thank you so much for
letting us stay, Mando.

I hope it's not a problem.

Listen, Dom needed a safe
delivered to Rio in two days.

That was a problem.

Hosting his family in
the Dominican Republic,

that is vacation.

Anyone messes with you here...

they're messing with the entire country.

You'll be safe.

Yeah, they're here. I picked
them up myself at the airport.

Hold on. Your brother.

Dom.

Yeah, Mia, it's me.

How's it going there?

We're at Mando's. This
place is like a fortress.

You should see Brian.
He's in full FBI mode.

He built a surveillance hub in
Mando's garage and everything.

What about you? Did you
find out who's after us?

Looks like the sins of London
have followed us home.

How did Buster take the news?

I can't tell him.

If he knew about the baby,
he'd stay here with us.

And with all that's going on,
you're gonna need him by your side.

Just watch out for him. Keep him safe.

And come home together.

Tell Brian I'll see him in LA in two days.

Where are you going?

Tokyo.

I'm bringing Han home.

Authorities are still
trying to determine...

the motive behind this daring
attack here at the office...

of the US Diplomatic Security
Service in downtown Los Angeles...

less than 36 hours ago.

Facts are still coming in...

but what is known is the suspect
entered the building's 4th floor...

Hey.

- You okay? - Yeah.

This guy's just, relentless.

That's why Dom needs you.

You two need to find this guy
and you need to stop him...

before he does any more
damage to our family.

I just...

I've screwed up so many things.

I couldn't live with myself
if I screwed this up, too.

You won't.

I believe in you.

I believe in us. That's all that matters.

I love you, Brian.

Love you, baby.

Just promise me. After this, we're done.

No more jobs, no more enemies.

Come back to us.

I won't let you down, Mia.

I know.

TOKYO, JAPAN

Hey yo, Sean!

Hey, check this out, man.

This dude over here wanna race the new DK.

Not tonight, Twinkie.

He said he knew Han.

Han said you was fast,
but not that damn fast.

Who said American muscle can't drift?

Han mentioned he left his
enemies in his rear view.

He never talked about it much.

Always playing it close to the vest.

We found a couple of things by the crash.

Wasn't much left.

Gisele.

Yeah.

There's one more thing.

I found this.

Must've meant something to him.

When you find the guy that killed Han...

What are you going to do?

Words ain't even been invented yet.

They say to live in the hearts
of those we leave behind...

is not to die.

But he put you in his grave.

So now I'll do the same to him.

I can't do no more funerals.

First, Han...

Now Hobbs is laid out, of all people.

We're being hunted.

You know he's out there
somewhere watching, right?

I hope so.

That means he's close.

Just promise me, Brian.

No more funerals.

Just one more.

His.

You never should've messed
with a man's family.

I told your brother the same thing.

Reinforced your chassis.

Just like going into the
ring with weighted gloves.

Your mistake. I'm not here to play games.

See, you and me...

We're from different worlds.

Trust me, I've seen a lot meaner
streets than the ones you're used to.

Stick around.

It's gonna get a lot meaner.

You think this was gonna be a street fight?

On the ground!

Now!

Drop him or I will drop you!

Woah, woah!

Easy, guys. We're on the same team here.

Mr. Toretto...

I'm here on the recommendation...

of a, mutual friend of ours.

- Mr. Hobbs? - Who the hell are you?

Me? I'm just a guy.

I'm, Mr. Nobody.

That's a big entrance for a nobody.

And the guy who put our mutual
friend in the hospital...

you just let him get away.

I think I might've just
saved your ass there, Dom.

Listen, you think you can
let go of my guy there?

He's beginning to turn a little blue.

I appreciate that.

Here they come.

Listen, Dom.

There's a war going on between
shadows and ghosts like me.

You and your team unwittingly walked
into the middle of it in London...

and it appears it's now followed you home.

It's up to you.

I'm gonna have a beer.

You're welcome to join me.

By the way, I can get you Deckard Shaw.

BASE OF OPERATIONS EL SEGUNDO, CALIFORNIA

Belgian ale.

Man, those monks got it right.

I don't know about the whole celibacy
thing, but when it comes to beer...

Would you like one?

I'm more of a Corona man myself.

Your files, not only detailed...

It's, extremely entertaining.

Look, Shaw's power is that he's a shadow.

He's really good at getting
in and out of places...

without being seen and leaving nothing
but a body count in his wake.

He's a legitimate English badass.

But to be honest with you Dom, I don't
give two shits about Deckard Shaw.

It's you I want.

Because you and I can help each
other get what we both need.

I'm listening.

Just recently, a private
military company...

led by a wanted terrorist
named Mose Jakande...

kidnapped a hacker known
only by the name "Ramsey".

Lady Liberty's got her panties in a
bunch over this but rightfully so...

because this Ramsey has created
something interesting.

- Bring it up. - Yes, sir.

Say hello...

To God's Eye.

Now this little bastard hacks into
anything that's on a digital network.

That means every cellphone,
satellite, ATM machine, and computer,

simultaneously.

If it's got a microphone or a lens,
God's Eye can use it to find you.

So you invited me here to
show me a tracking device.

On steroids. Lots of them.

Let me put it to you this way.

It took us nearly a decade
to find Osama bin Laden.

With this, we could locate
him anywhere on the planet

in a couple of hours.

Now that's a serious piece of machinery...

that could be catastrophic
in the wrong hands.

But for some very nauseating,
political reasons...

any rescue plans involving any US
government forces or entity...

has been strictly ruled out.

And that's why I need you.

But why do I need you?

I mean I could go back outside,
enjoy the rest of the Coronas...

let Shaw come to me.

You could do that. How's that
working out for you so far?

You got one friend in the ground,
another one in the hospital...

and then of course there's that
little issue of the bomb...

that destroyed your home.

Shaw lives in a world that
doesn't play by your rules.

Like it or not...

you live in that world now, too.

You wanna know how to kill a shadow?

You just shine a little light on it.

If you get the God's Eye for me...
